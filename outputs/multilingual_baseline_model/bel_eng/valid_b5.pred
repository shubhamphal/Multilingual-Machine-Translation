(Cheering) I look to Alaha from Santa, and my name has Alaha, peace and peace.
I was born in a middle class family.
That's why I'm so lucky.
My mother was born 1,6 children.
With 1,6 children, only five were still alive.
Imagine what my childhood was.
What I've seen is women who have not been in the smell, or children who have gone to go to the grave.
I wanted to be a doctor to help women and children.
Sadly, my country had no international support for the women, so I was accepted to the emergency room, but I couldn't get it.
And my father asked me to speak to America.
I went to America.
I learned my education.
And as I was learning, I was walking around in the middle of the Vietnamese race.
You know, when I was at school, I didn't even know what happened to my family and my country's family.
And after a month, I didn't know anything.
My family was in camps for whitemen.
As soon as I went to college, I moved my family to America.
I wanted them to be safe.
Where was my heart?
My heart was in Asphanta.
I had a job.
I gave you college education.
And so I went to run to the lavarians.
When I came to this lagoon in Paris, I saw 7.5 million whitemen, 7.5 million whitemen.
Ninety-nine percent of them were women and children, most men, have been killed or voted, and you know, when I was in the lagoon.
When I interviewed the interviews, I discovered things that you can't imagine and imagine.
I saw in the morning of the kids who sat down and crying, and she didn't know what to do.
I saw a young woman who couldn't go to school, had no education, no fun, no place for life.
It was a very staggering experience.
At that moment, we're talking about the impression of the impression.
"And at that moment, I asked myself, "What can I do for these people?""
How can I help them?
At that moment, I realized that education changed my life.
She changed me, she gave me a status.
At that moment, I realized that I had to give my master to education and health, and I started working on that.
Can you see what was easy to do?
Not because at that point, education was particularly fun to women.
"And she said, ""I want to do this."" Who am I?"
Or do you ask me? Of course, not.
That's why I had to build trust in this community.
So how did I do that?
I interviewed the observations, and I looked at it, and I looked around.
I've been referring.
I was 80 years old.
It was hard.
"He looked at me, and he said, ""Well, a boy, a boy, a teacher."" And I said, ""How can I be a teacher?"" And I said to him, ""I'm going to be angry with you as a teacher."" And then, as I started to learn from him, the news started to tell him."
Almost one year later, we've had 25 schools, and 15,000 children in these schools have been charged. It's incredible.
Of course, we're doing this, and we're doing this, we're educators, we're asking women to fail, we're asking people's principles, we're trying to decipher them, we're doing a lot of training, and one day I'm going to tell you.
One time I was in Beijing, Postistan.
"And all of a sudden, I saw my work walk to the room, closed doors and said to me, ""That's true, don't you?"" If you're a brilliant thing, what do you do?"
You've heard it. You know it's dangerous.
You know what your life is about.
But as a ruler, you have to be a husband.
You have to spare and report power.
So I invite them to come up with me.
They came. They would come. They would come to the factory.
I invite them to sit down, and I demand harmony.
They refused, they said they're not going to write a balance.
Of course, they're a thin voice that they're talking to me, and I'm very, very scared. I really got to speak.
But I was strong, I was held hard.
"They said, ""What are you doing?"
My employees started out in the office.
They've set up to open our clicks.
My mother and my children's children's rights.
Growth training on social care.
We've done all the training that you can imagine.
I was happy. I was fascinated by the results of my work.
One day I had four steps, one teacher, and I went to the middle of Kabul, and it suddenly stopped us by the side of the road by 19 firms.
They've taken us out of visitors on beaches, and they've opened us up.
This time we're all over here.
Let's see where you've been planted.
Everyone's going to come home. Nobody's left.
I was just a shower. I lost my voice.
They came across hundreds of women to get education.
So, I sat there and suddenly — in this moment, we're talking about a jaw — at this point, one of my great donors was born on the right side of the star.
"And she said, ""Are you talking?"" I said, ""I mean, you know, I've heard it."
Today, these people are good at teaching me.
And — (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)
This shows that education transforms people.
I live in a country that was beautiful and good.
I just want to share with you.
We could tell where we wanted to go.
Do you know what happened to my country?
Today, people can't walk from home, and it's almost true that they don't want to be safe.
But we want to go back to the story of Affiti.
They get smoke and they learn from bribes.
He said that compassion and love can be charged by the universe.
Sir-functional: What do you want?
Klifer: Hmm, let's look at it.
Sirverver: The Prappam under a blended-up mistake, the best-group of data data data, the starchers from the bottom of the water, the CEO's, the CEO's of Kantra, the cabinet of the Kuikeriker, the cabinet behind the police police, and they're done with cows.
Kleifer: I mean, please, if you ask for an officer's office room, and you're going to throw out your best haircuts.
Sirver: What's a young boy?
We don't have a great high-performance record.
Kleifer: Yeah, let's cut the rainbow, if it's annoying.
Sirverver: It's out there.
I quickly service your evidence.
(Applause) My Penn: I'm painting from now, and I've learned to keep a piece of music from the Russian hand, and I'm painting cartoons with three gallonies.
And then I figured out who's an example of that.
Now, there's been a lot of programmers that most children don't know.
"When I realized that there are people who make cartoons that I look at the screen, I'll tell you, ""I'm going to be an operator."" I don't know if I said that, or myself, but it was a big decision for my life."
The imitation and the art of art have always been the best on the right.
"But the curiosity of computer science came up with this idea of building ""The Books Disease,"" and then I started with my computer, and I thought, ""What if there was a little computer out there in the computer?"" And I thought, ""What if there's a little lights in the computer?"
Could there be an SLO where they come together to be able to grow up?
So what's called the Building Data is born.
When I was four years old, the taboo showed me how to pick up a computer and put it back.
And that's how I got to get out of computer science.
The first one I've ever built is HTML, and now I'm going to speak JavaScript and Pyt.
"I'm also developing a new operating facility, which is called ""Apollers."" It's about bees and other pollinators that are out there, and why they're good."
If flowers don't pollinate pollinators, all of the inventions that come from plants, we've gone off the road, we've gone off the road.
So I decided to use these cool designs and make them a superhero superhero.
(Applause) (Ringing) (Music) (Singing) (Singing) (Singing) Audience: Abuse! Sorry more!
We need to look for the limits of the Aldomians!
(Music) Thank you. (Applause) All of my installations have come up with ideas, but what is ideas?
Healthy can be empowered.
Health is a new set of developments.
Because of the visions, it's really amazing to see light.
If we weren't ideas, we wouldn't be where we were now, wouldn't be technology or engineering, wouldn't be art, culture, our shame of life.
"When I was eight years old, I took my ideas and I opened up a company called ""The Mali Foundation,"" and with him, the foundation of ""The National Malthy for the planet."
(Laughter) So I'm a product of ecological innovation and stocks.
I'm 13 now, and despite the fact that I started with a company in 2008, my artist had come up much earlier.
I've always had a huge impact on art, and I wanted to enlarge it to everything that I was doing on my own company.
And I was thinking, you know, you know, you know, you can make a shuffle or a shepherd — I had so much idea of putting a piece of material out there.
"And I noticed that when I was wearing my expressions, I was stopped on the street and I said, "What is it? Where can you eat that?""
And I thought, you know, you can do something about it and discover businesses.
Because I was only eight years old, and I had no business plan.
I just knew that I wanted to produce a wonderful thing, things that were unleashed by plants, and that I wanted to share with you the ones that I was less likely to have in my life.
My science taught me to go wide, and I went to the chaos and put my head on the side of the lecture, and in the birts, I wrote a name and I checked for every single unit of my body.
So I started building more expressions like shepherds and tangles and axes.
Understand, my students started to buy money all over the world, I've got people in Dana, Italy, Canada and other countries.
Well, I had to learn a lot about driving on the right, such as the company's company's name and spray, how to support relationships with people, and see that it's better or worse.
After all, the Swedish started to grow.
And one day, when I was 10 years old, I had to write Forebys.
(Laughter) They wanted to write about me and my company in his bookbook.
How many of you are trying to, why are my ecological expressions?
With a little old age, I've been really interested in changing environments and making sure that they live in them.
My parents have taught me to share with the people who are less likely to care, and to think and to be able to go to the environment.
I found out that painting was a problem for clothing or even a process of stuff that was dangerous for people and planets, and I started my research, and I realized that even after the procrastination, there was a problem for the environment to see what to do with the wildlife.
After all, they're able to develop scaffolding paint, or they're in their own dry paint.
That's what air is doing, and it's doing it with all the air and all the rest of us who breathe it.
So when I started with a company, I knew two things: All my expressions have to be ecological, and that 10 to 20 percent of my organization has to give up the local and the international aid organizations.
(Applause) I think I'm part of a new entrepreneurial entrepreneur who doesn't just want to raise money, but it's also very sustainable for the world.
I believe I can take my customers and save their lives for generations to live a more ecological life.
We live in a big, diverse and wonderful world, and I'm even more willing to protect it.
It's not enough to imagine what's happening in the world in mind and mind, it's not enough.
All you have to do is bring through your heart, because that's where the idea of the organism is to fly.
And that's when inventions look at the world, so ideas are realities.
Thank you, everybody's peace and well-being.
(Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Pat Mitchell: You heard me talk about my parents who sleep at this magical woman. Where did they come?
I mean, let's see, ladies and gentlemen Pan, maybe you ... Wow.
(Applause)
So here's a couple of things that you're going to know about clustering.
In fact, it's exquisite matching with some of the creativeities.
They're municipal collection of traits, and they're connected to each other's gravitationalities.
Most of the croaps that you see on the screen are not dead stars, but collection of zones, or galaxies.
Now, let me show you some of these things, and I hope you'll quickly see that the combination of galaxies isn't just a wonderful thing, but more than that, I think that there's a combination of mystery, they're recognizing, and they're good.
Carsar as the source of the smallest laboratory in the universe.
And in your vision, the description of the idea of the notion of the experiment that you can end up with.
I think there are four primary challenges, and the first kind of thing that we want to forget about is that it's not really great.
In fact, how great is that?
All right, that's one of the other things that you're missing.
It's so small that the light that's coming through it, you're waking up, you're talking about it because it's an emergency room for that connection.
And when you really look really excited, you can see the circles around you.
In order to be smart, it's this combination of galaxies that have more capacity for more than one billion sponsors.
It's incredible how small these systems can be.
But more than that, they have a positive feature.
They're basically coordinated by systems, and when you're really excited, we can think of them as small parts of the universe.
"And in many ways, the ones that might leave us, the judgment of the universe, for example, "The theory of gravity?""
You can answer those systems to study.
So that's what we've been talking about in an extraordinary way.
The other kind of thing is that these things are very hot.
So if you take the composition of the complexity, and you're going to get all the light that you're connected to, then you're going to have this big, big, big rabbit.
It's not a slow wheel.
What we see here is really natural light.
And then the big question is, if that's not the case, what's going to produce that light?
Suppose we're going to be a mountain of gas, a gas in a million grabs — that's true of swimming.
You can find this mountain of rocks in the last few places.
The appropriate gravitational gravitation of these systems is coming together, and it's built by a large gallon, and it's a huge testament, and it's a huge test.
That's the fundamental meaning, but it's just the science of the elite.
Now, there's also a lot of other things that are particularly simple for us, as long as we're still awakening, and yet we're pushing our understanding of the physics of the super-graduate chain.
The third is learning very mildness.
To give you a sense of this, I need to tell you about a prisoner about the fact.
Most of the engineering universe is done not with attack.
Your mother had been given up.
Most of it comes from something very mysterious, which we call dark materials.
The value of matter is something that's not very good for people, except for gravity, and, of course, we're going to love to learn more about it.
If you're interested in physical care, you're interested in what happens when we pull something apart.
And dark matter is not exclusive.
So how can we do that?
"And I want to answer that question, and I want to ask you to say something else, "What if you combine your ears to look at?""
Let's look at the challenge.
And we remember that there's a little bit of excitement as if you're a meadow of the universe, just a little bit of representation.
They're going to move around with dark winds, and that's what you see in that blinked bullet.
Seven is a mountain of gas, and, of course, you can see a lot of stuff.
So what's going on here is, you've got a windmaker in a very, very large scale.
And that's really important, because it means that it's very, very small, and it's hard to get out of the lab, and it's able to get together and sleep in something we can see in the background.
So, it was very good.
And so the reason the interesting integration can teach us what dark matter is, the reason why unleashes can teach us about physics is that they're so profound.
Charting is something: physics is very strange.
It's real time when you're awake your head.
If there's any more strange thing to do, it has to be dark energy.
If I squeeze air in the air, I expect it to hurt.
But I don't expect that he's going to fly away from all the pain and the pain at the same time.
So, psychologists say why the universe has been expanding.
They don't understand why he's expanding all the pain at the bottom.
They give it an accelerated expansion of the name and give it dark energy.
And we need to know more about this.
And then one of the things that comes to mind is, how is dark energy affecting the universe at a greater scale?
You can get it hard, you can build your own fish more or less on it.
And the problem with the universe is that it's terrible.
Let's look at software.
We need to get it right.
I love thinking about it, talking about anatomy.
To know how you take a student, the most important thing is not the model of the place, but every little piece of the Arab who was concerned about.
The biggest important thing is to study the best private people.
So I can learn so much about the world in the greatest scale, with its greatest private parts, and those parts are the integrations of the universe.
Now, I'm going to leave you with a talk, but you can experience yourself a little bit of embarrassment.
So I mean, what do I do about how good it is, how good is it about compounds, and I asked a few of these reasons, but how do they really use it?
Well, to answer me, I want to spend Henry Ford when they asked him about cars.
"And what he said was, ""When I tried to people who needed them, they would say, ""Well, they need faster cows"" to our society."
And the solution is not clear.
They're not faster than the skin.
They're asking a very large number of science inventions.
So what we need to do is we need to zoom in, but we also need to remember the innovation, the inventions, the hope of this stuff, comes from how we've expanded our field when we step back when we step back, when we look back at our time.
And for me, the best way to do this is to study the universe around us. Thank you.
(Applause)
"So imagine you find on the street in America and come to your Japanese and say, "Hey, what does this mean?""
"And you're like, ""Well, that's Oklawatting, and that's the Electronym."
"It's called to be shocked, and it's like, ""Well, good."" And he says, ""Well, what's called this piece?"" And you say, ""Well, please, there's no name in the back."
"The people have names; the name is just a white space between the Africans."" And he passed away, a little bit of a little bit of a gratification and a lot of frustration."
"Now, imagine you're on the street right now, somewhere in Japan, walking to someone along with you and saying, "Sorry, what's it called this guy?""
"They say, ""Oh, well, here's the 17th of them, and that's 16."" And you say, ""Well, good, but what's called this guy?"" And they say, ""Well, how do you say in the wrong word."
There's a name for food.
Look at Google Maps. There are 14, 15, 1, 17, 18, 19.
All of these things are called names, and Slovenians are just a white space between the barks.
"And you're saying, ""Well, good, but how do you know your neighbor's address?"" And she says, ""Well, that's simple: That's the rainbow."
"So you have 17, the house number one, and you say, ""That's great. But if you look around the room, I noticed that there's no right-handed device."" And she says, ""Well, it's true. It's not true. It's true if it's built."
The house that was built in a dish is the number one home.
The house that was built was number two.
"Three houses are home number three. That's simple. That's obvious."" Here's me, I love that sometimes we need to get on the other side of the ground to understand something that we didn't even know, and to understand that there's absolutely no reason why we're wrong with things."
So for example, in China, there are doctors who believe that their work is to protect your health.
So every month, if you don't get enough, you don't pay them, and if you don't pay them, you don't pay them, because they can't just manage your work, and they're wealthy if you're healthy, not if you're paying enough.
(Applause) Almost any music music, it's a lifespan, it's an instrument of music. One, two, four.
"Just in North African music, this is the end of the phrase, and by the end of the story."
You can hear it not only in the words, but also how they think it's two, three, four times, four times.
And this May also is the right one.
(Laughter) What I'm saying is that in every single thing that we're talking about about India, there's an argument that's also true.
So let's not forget that at TED, or something else that doesn't matter what you're looking at in your mind or what you're doing, it's against the distraction too can be true.
Doozamathiathaaaaaataaaaaaaaaa.
