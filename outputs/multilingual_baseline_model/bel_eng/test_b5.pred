Until this year, we're going to have about a billion people in the planet, and we're going to use a computer.
Sort of them together, they share what happens when they die.
Now that's a terrible thought, but I think that's my profound consequences to look at.
And I remember thinking about it after the night of David C.M. Miller, the science fiction magazine, who died of cancer.
Mayor asked his family and friends to write a mystery that was published after his death.
This is what he wrote at the beginning.
"He said, ""That's what I died, and that's my last dish."
"I asked my body to get rid of the river, my family, and I interviewed the research project that I wrote as the first piece of moving my mind into art."" I was not sure that, as a journal, Michelle could be a writer, and Miller would be better at the right-hand side of his body, in fact, in fact, in fact, the art that all of the art today is very different from what's been defined by the next generation."
Let's look at a little bit of tests.
Today, 48 hours of video are uploaded to YooTub, which is bad.
What we're going to do is we're going to get 200 million tweets.
Nick usership generates 90 percent of the content per month.
If you think about your parents or grandparents, in the best way, they've created a few pictures of photos, or a video, or a doorstep that's hidden in it.
But today, we're creating an incredibly rich number of armies that will live in an acute life as long as we die.
And I think this creates an incredibly intriguing opportunity for the technology.
For me, I'm a journal, not a technologist, so I'd like to erase the images of the modern world and the future will be similar.
We've already seen some services that enable us to decide what's going to happen with online hobbyes and nitric oxides in the garden after our death.
One of them is pretty year old, and I found me panicki in the coffee shop, a Friendmanian restaurant.
(Recording) Adam: Hi.
Child: Adam?
A: Yeah.
Seven: The death can break you anywhere in the world at any hour, even in Ar Uganda.
A: Who is that?
"Just say, ""Come on idie.nut, [I'm a memorial.""] Until I became too late."
(Laughter) A: I mean, isn't it true?
This service is doing pretty simple things: it allows you to create a message or a video that can be published on Facebook after your death.
Second service service has a long time to remember.
It allows online to connect the inner love and to fill this picture with pictures and videos and narratives that they can post post after their death.
But then it's just interesting.
Many of you have probably heard about David Roy, who's in a gardening show, how he's able to do more than 90 hours of video.
And I think that with improving the ability of the machine to understand the language and to innovate the big, seventh-gregistered, it's going to be possible to test the content for life — the tweets, the video, the blog, into the dish — that we're producing lots of gaps.
And I think as soon as that will happen, for our digital individual, we will have an open-source view of the real world after our deaths, because of the power of the content that we've created and the ability to reach technology to understand that meaning.
Now we're going to look at a couple of experiments.
There's a key message, my next Tweet, he's understanding all of your records in your vets, all you've missed, and it's making predictions that you can write the next one.
So as you can see, the result can be cascade.
Imagine something that someone would look like in five or 20 years from improving technical power.
You've got to go forward, and the research lab at MIT is working on robots that can communicate like people.
And if the robots were able to connect to the foundations of every single human being, hundreds of thousands of content that the person has created for his whole life.
Now, you'll notice that the U.S. nightly, when CNN's foot had a big fan of WillI.A. for interviewing the U.S. Nupreme night in 2008 when Cupreme Cup's studio took place.
What if we could use this technology to design our loved ones in the living room, trying to capture a very unthinkable landscape, based on the end that they've created as long as possible?
And I think it's all possible for us to build our data and technology tools for their analysis to grow up in a gymmetric way, as long as we create our data.
As a result, I think we all need to think about, do we want it to be real? And if that's true for life and what's next?
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Druggling is from the challenges of administration.
Sadly, the evidence of these questions is like this.
And then you can do that and you can test them.
What do we know about complex systems?
You know, it's literally a system that doesn't make sense of its parts.
Where's the economy infrastructure?
We've been at my seventh birthday.
What a visionary bias predicted was what it was going on.
""How are they organized?"" "They're doing self-assembly?""
These are companies that work in more than one country, and there are 43,000 of them.
I'll get through suspended animation.
So I want to talk to you about what's wrong with love.
I don't know about you, but when I look at this metaphors, I see a stage with a cartoon — like this guy, he walks in a walk, and he doesn't notice he's coming to the open man and he's stuck in the field.
And I think that's exactly how I feel, because I'm not saying that.
The name is sudden and unexpected.
It's something that happens to us without our permission.
I spoke and a teacher in English, which means thinking about words, I've spent my life working on life.
You can say, and I want to stress that many metals we cover to talk about love — perhaps a big part of them — have a problem.
So love, we give.
They're beaten.
They grow.
We're giving the jump.
We're blowing out of the smell.
The name makes us crazy, and it makes us sick.
The front of the door, and then the lights down.
So our metaphors redefine our relationship to someone who's sexy or disease.
(Laughter) That's right.
And what they're doing is they're taking us back and forth and out of the wrong circumstances.
"My favorite friend is ""smaten,"" which is, over the past form of the word ""mit."" And if you look at that word in the elephant — (Laughter) you realize that it means ""smaten,"" and ""smaten."" And as I say, ""smit"" with a very profound word, it's very old."
"And at the bottom of the room, there's one in the bottom of the room that says, ""Phuten,"" which is used to remember the great God."
(Laughter) We're talking about the same words to talk about love, which is an indicative orchard. (Laughter)
Right?
So how did this happen?
So how did we get to this transformation of love with a big battle and a suffering?
And why do we talk about this as a good experience, as if we've lost?
These are tough questions, but I have a few theories.
And in order to argue that, I want to focus on one of the key metaphors that brings love like crazy things.
When I first started studying my friends' love, I met these metaphors all over the place.
In the history of the Western culture of wealth, the monks that are committed to love for mental illness.
Here's a few examples.
It was when I fell in love in 20 years, and it was pretty humbling relationships from early days.
It was relationships for just a few years, so for me, it was very high levels and low distances.
I remember one moment.
I sat down in South America, and I watched my love come out of the door.
And it was, in fact, almost all night, that we had lost care, and when we went to our room, he left his stuff in Toruba, and he had a big argument.
Now, I don't remember thinking about this argument, but I remember remember watching his son again.
I was 22 years old, and it was my first traveler in the country, and I was absolutely alone.
I went home a week, and I knew the name of the city in which I found, and the name of the city that I needed to get to kissing, but I didn't have a sense of empathy.
I didn't have a jacket to talk about food and very little money, and I didn't know Spanish.
Somebody else could laugh for me as a moment of possibility, but I was stuck.
I just sat there.
And then we turned around.
"But even though I got to college, a little voice in my head thought, ""Wow. It was unnecessary."
"I really love the inner way."" (Laughter) Because I don't want to be part of me to experience love with love."
Now this sounds so strange to me, but at age 22, I wanted to have unthinkable experiences, and at that point, I had no misunderstood, I lost my breath, and it's quite amazing, but I thought it was a little bit strange, but I thought, well, it's a little bit of a cliche of my mind to the guy who just told me.
I think, at a certain point, I would like to be a little bit crazy, because I thought that's how love and how it works.
"It doesn't really have to be weird, and it's going to be amazing to notice that there are eight filters on the Internet, 14 pseuds, two or two singers, and one of them called ""The Warsman."" And then, over the course of the day, he came to our room."
We've been born.
But if you want someone like this, it's like I'm passionate about my love experience — it wasn't very good for me or for him.
But I think this kind of love is not really unusual.
Most of us feel like we're a little bit of a little bit of an early experience of love.
In fact, there's a study that says it's wrong, because neuroscience tells you that it's wrong, because it's not that easy to fix it, it's not that easy to fix it.
It's really true.
This study in 1999 uses blood analysis to show that the levels of grayness are very similar to the levels of grayness are very similar to the levels of gray gray in humans with a diagnosis of superficial stimulus.
(Laughter) So, the income rate of the forest is also connected to a series of gray alphabets and depression.
So there's a few prove to you that love is about changes in our mood and our behavior.
And other studies of patching out that most of our relationships begin this way.
The investigators say that there's an unequal level of division between people who are interconnected with an eye-to-person relationship, and it feels like someone's friends had a sense of mind-wandering.
And most of us feel like it's the first time we're encrypted.
I decided that if my friends couldn't understand my suffering, I don't need their friends.
So I stopped meeting with a lot of them.
And this was probably the most unfortunate year in my life.
But I think I feel like I'm not anecdotal — it's my job, because if I was too late, then I'd be able to tell him how much I loved him.
And if I could say that, then we'd end up all the time.
And that's true of the crazy, because there's no universal rule, which suggests that a lot of suffering leads to a big reward, but we talk about love as if it's true.
It's about experience of love and biologically and culture.
Our biologies tell us that love is a good thing by putting a reward on our brains and telling us that love is a barren when you're having an argument or an argument, a neuro-productive reward lies.
In fact, you've probably heard about this — talking about neuroscience, trying to see the rampant templation of the cascade, which is, I'm going to spend a lot of time talking about.
(Laughter) And then our culture uses language to paint and restore that vision of love.
In this case, we're talking about metaphors of pain and madness.
It's a pretty interesting storm from other contacts.
It's powerful and it's sometimes balanced, and we've seen that through our words and our history, but then our words and our history are increasing to the expectation of the strongest and the strongest love.
Interestingly, it's all happening in a culture that's kind of frowning masks.
It's as though we want you to want crazy love, and we want it to have a long life.
It's terrible.
(Laughter) To do that, we need to change our culture or change our expectations.
Imagine that we were all less likely to be in love with.
If we were more confident, more open-source, more cavemen, and then instead of giving it love, we would be in his eye.
I know it requires a lot of things, but I'm not the first person to suggest this.
"In the book, ""The Leaders we live"" by Martin Jokkins and George Lake's book suggesting that there's a great solution to this hole: We need to change our metabolism."
They claim, and they even act as leaders of our future, and they say, procrastinate.
Joshphones and Lakafaf proposed new metaphors to love: Kahani as a collection of art.
I love this way of thinking about love.
Linguists say that metrics are common in nature, and there's a way to look at all of these articles, or ideas that fit in metal.
Joshensin and Lakeafaf is talking about everybody who's working on the art of the product, you're rocking, rocking, big action.
And these ideas make a good culture worth bringing in long-term relationships, but they also work well in other relationships — short-term relationships, extreme, silent, unintelligent, endless — because these metrics are many more complex ideas in love with each other.
So if love is a collection of creative art, love is an aesthetic experience.
It's not fair, it's loveful, it's loveful, it requires employment and dysfunction, it's exhausting and it's egomatic.
And love is good and pain.
After all, every experience of love is different.
When I was young, I'd never thought about it, you know, you'd never think you'd have anything you'd say about love.
When Juillt's watch was waited for the first time, or when she was chatting to the age of Joyal's Day, she couldn't be without Raja, with whom she was four days ago, she wasn't frustrated or excited.
Where did she come?
She wants to die.
Right?
And as you're thinking, at this point, at the moment of time, watching three out of five, Razi is not dying.
He's alive, he's healthy, he's just exterior from the city.
I understand that Veron 16th is not like the modern North America, but when I first read this dog, also at 14 years old, Jillage had a meaning for me.
Jealousy thinks of love as something I'm creating with who I'm fascinated with, not something that just happens to me without my control or my sleep, it's a dense inner power.
But it's still hard.
One of the things that I'm thinking about is that sometimes it's absolutely irrelevant, and when I feel embarrassed, I have to remind myself that my job in these relationships is to talk to my partners about what I want to do together.
It's also a little bit too.
But it's much better than the second option that love is crazy.
It's the first love that you don't care about, whether you're not paying attention.
Instead, it requires a partnership and a relief when it comes to trying to understand it's hard, that it's very simple, but in fact, it's a revolutionary language.
I mean, you've got to stop thinking about yourself and your money or your country in those relationships, and start thinking about what you might like.
"And so the second love allows us to say things like, "Hey, we're not a good job; we don't think it's for us.""
"Or, ""All these relationships were shuffled than I was crying, but it was such a wonderful thing."" Now, the art of the art is that it's not good or not to blame itself."
That's the same love that allows us to solve what it looks like.
Thank you.
(Applause)
In the 95s, I was a student with a friend of mine who was traveling to the Air Force city, which was in the state of Rod Island, to the Protected city, which was 5,000 miles away in Argon.
And you know how it goes when you're little and you're ignorant, or we're not late at school, but mostly the national paddle, the national hand hand, we're talking about it, the longest path.
In southern Dako, I turned to friendship, and I started to realize that I was over 3,000 years old.
""What is this character that's all over the road?""
She's wearing her eyes overnight.
So let's say, let's sit for the first time very precisely what it's like right now.
"(Laughter) And I said to her, ""You know, the people who are over the road, that they're from China."" She's going to look at me a few more moments, and then she's laughing at me, because she understands."
That's what I'm saying.
(Laughter) Here he is, this famous famous place for a email. (Laughter)
In the past five years, I've spent a lot of time thinking about this — why we're sometimes misunderstood signs around us, and how we're doing it, and what we're really aware of is human beings.
So in a different way, I've spent the last five years thinking about this.
My choice of cardboarders can give you a terrible, but it's got a huge shift in it: no carpet at the business room.
(Laughter) In fact, most of us would be outside of thinking about your attainment, or maybe try not to think about the ability of your hometown.
We understand this.
We realize that sometimes every room in this room is wrong.
We are people who don't care about it. All right, let's do it.
But on the right-hand side, this moment, I believe, at this time, all of the extrapolations that look like this, you know, it's a kind of anecdote, and I can't imagine I'm wrong.
What's interesting is that we live in this data over time.
We're going to meet them, and they're sorry to watch a vacation, and they're sorry to go to the gorps and give their voice to them.
And I'm sure we're all in the middle of life in the bed that we believe we always have the right thing.
That's a problem for me.
And in my view, it's a problem as each and every one of us, on a personal level, as a professional level, and all of us together as a society.
What I'm going to leave you with today is the first thing to do, because we're going to get into our senses of our rightness.
Secondly, that's why this approach is so problematic.
And so I want to convince you that you might be able to walk around the scale of your mind, and when you do that, it's the best of all in the hopelessness and mind and creativity that you can do.
Why are we so tempting to hear your hearing?
One of the things that's connected to is sensitivity.
So let's ask you, maybe you're up here, because I'm very excited if you're not right?
It's sad. I'm sorry.
It's amazing. It's great, it's cool, it's super.
It's amazing, it's not wonderful, it's not sensitive, it's a family's sense, they're all cool messages, but they answer the next question.
"You answer the question, "I feel like you're not right.""
(Laughter) Let's acknowledge your misunderstanding experience, as was said, and yet all of a sudden, don't you?
For example, it might be a terrible sensation, or a sense of prejudice, or even a similar feeling, like my Chinese Draga.
But it's not very specific to any of these emotions.
So here's an analogy.
Do you remember a cartoon of Leunny Cutanese, where this minaret is about an hour of race, but you can't see the ice cream coming from the weather?
Almost every epiphany happens in this season that you're going to get out of the room, and you're going to see the guys on the side of the cliff, because you're talking about a pet, and you know, you're talking about it.
But every single time you're having a fairy tale, now you're complaining about it.
What's funny is, especially when you're only six years old, what's wrong with the calm too.
He just keeps walking until he's looking at the dose and seeing what he's looking at at in Latin.
That's when he got to show up.
If we're in something wrong, if we don't realize that we're wrong, and that's what we're like to have a pencil, and then we're going to get back to it.
You know, we've been wrong, we've already heard about it, but we still feel confident about it on the ground.
I need to get a little bit closer to what I said.
There's a sense of self-defense, which is the sense of your rights.
(Laughter) Since this wall, we've learned when we're connected to our own rights.
I'm going to leave you with this blindness.
Most of all, we don't have any of the information behind us if we're wrong, until we're wrong.
There's another reason why we're clinging to it, it's more relationships to culture.
Imagine a stutter of high school.
You're sitting in your room, and the teacher comes back with control, and one of them looks like this.
In fact, it's not my own.
(Laughter) Here you're in high school, and you know what you're thinking about as a one-parter, which has this argument.
He's a soul and a shaman, and he's never doing anything about it.
So, to a nine-year-old, you've learned that, first of all, those who are wrong with the forest and back and forth, and secondly, to achieve success in life, you're never going to be wrong.
We learn these lessons very hard.
Most of us, and I think, especially in this room, are treated with this incredible, unauthorized action, perfume, old-groupers.
Or don't the CEO CEO who's complaining about amputees, he's complaining about the dream of a dreamer?
(Laughter) So, as you're all of these CEOs, animations and marathons.
He's going to be.
It's the great thing that we're going to see if we're going to see that maybe we're wrong about it.
Because when we think about it, when we make it wrong, we decide that something is wrong with us.
So we persist on our own, because we feel intelligent, responsible, charismatic and protected.
Let me tell you about an accident.
A few years ago, the name of Bat Ezuel Service got a woman to operate.
This hospital lies in Boston.
In this talk, students from Guardd, he's one of the best students in the country.
There was a woman who came in, and she came up with the information behind the vehicle.
She's been paired under the right, and the surgeon's surgeon on her mud, and then he's chasing her, and then he's left behind her, and then he's got to get her out of the room.
And amazingly, operational surgery went wrong.
"The woman wakes up, and she says, ""Why am I not tied to the bar?"" And she's tied to the base, because the surgeon's surgeon has actually done a real surgery on her screen, not on the right."
When this story told me a good lesson to study as a processor, he told me something very surprising.
"Just hear the surgeon just heard that he was working on the right tower."" (Laughter) Why am I telling this story, because I'm telling the audience that you're going to find the right database, maybe it's very dangerous."
It's the inner sense of listening that we all feel sometimes can't listen to as the only panic of what actually happens in the ringing world.
And when we're focused only on that panavar, and we don't even think about the ability to make our misunderstood, we're doing stupid things like 760 million gallons on Maine here, or it's the definition of the global economy.
It's a brilliant problem for exercise.
But it's also a powerful problem for society.
Think about it in a minute, what does it mean to your rights?
That means that your belief doesn't make fun of the reality.
With this sense of problem, it's a narrow problem to explain all of the people that are not beneficial to you.
It turns out that most of us have told ourselves that people in other ways use blind assumptions.
The first thing we tend to think is that when someone in our lives is unhealthy, they don't know about data.
They just don't have a sense of information that you have, and when you're looking at this information, you're going to get into them, you're going to get them down to the floor, and they're five at your campfire.
If it doesn't happen, if we give them the same facilities we have, but we don't get tired of us, we move to the other side of the conversation — which is that they are.
(Laughter) Before they have all the pieces of paper, they don't have it, they can't pick it up.
And if that doesn't work, and if we realize that people with us don't get angry, meet the ones that are really smart, and then we're going to get to the third point — they know the truth, but for their excessive purpose, that's really exciting.
This is catalyst.
It's the kind of transformation that our sense of feeling doesn't give us any sense of failure, especially when it's acceptable, and it's hard for us to fight each other.
What I'm more obsessed with is that I think it's a tragic thing that's absolutely going to happen to our own existence.
It's as though we want to believe that our minds are such unauthorized through the windows that we can see them and exactly describe light.
And we want everybody to look at the world through that hair, and we want to see exactly the same thing.
It's hard to do, and if it was, the light would be absolutely zero.
The quality of our mind is not that we can see the light that it has.
It's the way we can see light in a way that we don't have light.
We can have memories about the future, thinking about the future, and we can imagine that we are other people in other places.
And it's because everybody sees it differently, we can look at that little bit of color and see it, and that's it, and that's it.
That's why we're wrong.
"In the 1200s, before Doug had spent his fame saying, ""I think and Thailand,"" and he said to them, ""I've written 'fallor seum.'"" and ""I'm wrong and I'm wrong."
And the author of courage realized that the fact that we're wrong is that it's not a bad fight for the human system, it's not something that's going to stopping, it's not something that's going to reduce the movement.
It's the essence of our humanity.
Because we're not afraid, we don't really know what the world is doing.
Unlike other animals, we endlessly try to recall that light.
I think it's an endless journey, and it's a coworker and a whole of our workplace and our fantasy.
"First of all the reasons, I started listening to a lot of college programs, ""This is American life,"" in a public consultant."
And then I came to mind, and I started to realize that all of these things were wrong.
"And at first I thought, ""You know, I was like, ""Yeah."
Now, I'm always like crazy, and I can see this pattern.
"And it seems everywhere."" So, you know, these experiences were all over me."
But how many months later, I had the opportunity to interview Arazy's company in Campaign.
"I'm going to share that view with him, and he's like, "It's really like that.""
He told me that the software engineers are even complaining that every college is the most natural world ever.
"She's doing something like this: ""I thought something like this, and it's really happened."" "What's interesting about it," is, we're giving Ara Goli's, 'cause we need to know this."
"We need this kind of moment of momentum and change in order to make these disasters happen."" What we're all in the audience, as we listen to, as we listen to it, as we listen to it, is that it's very important for us to recognize."
We like the stories of the story, the jewelry and the unexpected endeavor.
What we're talking about is what we're talking about, and we're really sorry about it.
But you know that our spreads like this, because our lives are like this.
We think it's going to happen, and actually it's not happening.
George Bush thought that Iraq was going to find out there was a ribbon of mass destruction, liberating people and allowing Brussels to the Service.
And it really happened.
Also, Huhammad Mubarak thought he would be an Eggler to the rest of his life until he's walking around and scraping, and then he's going to be able to move his grandfather's son's name.
And it really happened.
Maybe you've ever thought that you're going to do a lot of love with the school, you're going to go back to the mountain, and you're going to see how many things you're putting together.
And it really happened.
I have to confess that I had to say that I was writing a famous book about something that no one's ever done for reading who's never going to be.
And it really happened.
(Laughter) That's the same life.
We produce incredible ideas about light if it's a better way to make it happen, and some of it's not, and light is blowing and blowing us up.
Don't remember, but there's a question of how we remember our failure.
We've estimated a whole week about innovation, enhancement and enhancement, but you know, why do we need these innovations, enhancement and interventions?
Because half of the ideas that were crazy and interesting and capable of changing light — look at TED in 1998, looking at what's going on there.
(Laughter) Didn't it work like that? (Laughter)
Where's my perfect quality, Chris? (Laughter)
(Applause) And we're over here again.
And that's what's going to happen.
We're going to have another idea.
We're talking about another story.
We're on another session.
At the age of the age, you've already heard 7 million times as you've ever heard before, trying to figure out the wonderful thing.
"And so if you really want to invent a wonderful thing, you're going to get out of the limits of this terrible and frightening space of your rights and look at each other, and look at each other, and you're also looking at the other, and you're also looking at the distraction, and you're looking at the heart and you're looking at the eye and saying to yourself, ""Well, I don't know."
"Maybe I wrong."" Thank you."
(Applause) Thank you very much. (Applause)
Fifty-four-four-year-old Scientists and Scientific Environment Government went down to the streets in Malannenene, and flew to Mayor Kahnanne, the ruler of the hubris.
At first, Nazar acknowledged in the wild, but by encompassing other assaults, he and his team started paying attacks on his head, and he started paying attention to New York City's weaknesses, including Tanslin and the headquarters of Architecture.
Thankfully, these plans were handled by FBI's whistleblowers.
But sadly, the Galaxy smelled in 1993 at the Sub-Saharan Garden Environment did not exist.
As a result, Nazar judgment has been judged in the Western world.
The story of Nazaro is my father.
I was born in Protection, Beijing, in 1983, in a weekly engineering engineer and a mother's mother, who's a young woman, who's a young woman, who's a young woman, who's a young woman, who's a young boy, and he's a young woman, and he's a school together, and he's trying to make my childhood a happy boy.
But when I was seven years old, when I was sleeping in our family, it started to change.
My father showed me the Islam that little people will notice, including even a majority of Muslims.
My experience shows that when people recognize one person, they don't need a lot of time to realize that at the same time, we all want one.
However, in every aspect of this, every one in the world has found a few processes of people who are so data-driven, believe that you need to use any kind of resources to help others live on their rules.
In a couple of months, the father had planted me and told me that the last few years he and his friends had been on the dear Lagda Island for training.
He said next morning, I'll go with him.
So we went to the Kolverston, and we came down to the FBI.
That day, my last survivor fell into a small orange forest on a marshmallow, and, yes, I was particularly amazed, and especially my worldwide disability began to turn on the flames.
"My grandfather turned to friends, and he said to Arabic, ""Even."" The father, that son, and that son."
They were all very, very different than that, but only a few years later, I realized her meaning was completely different.
They saw me come to this country that my father was, who my father was.
And as a result of those people have judged over a breakthrough van that was loaded with family collisions in the lowlands of the North Pacific Group, which led to death to the seven-year-old man, was injured for more than a thousand years.
These were the men that I was worried about.
"The people I called ""aa,"" which means, ""Huh.""
Every time I began to experience myself in one place, I was going to be able to show things and move to another government.
You always have a new face in class, and I've been a lot of fun.
I've been told to judgments people to come to the fundamental circumstances of the world, such as generosity or race.
So what opened my eyes?
The first thing that happened was that we had a problem with this idea of thinking, and it happened during the election of the World War.
After training a program, I was able to shout at the National Enlightenment in Palm.
The groups of our groups represent some of the world's most different planes.
One day, I found out that one of my new friends was a rabbit.
I've never had any friends of hubris before, and honestly honestly, I've made sure that I've overhearted the banner, who I've lived almost everything in my life.
The fourth moment was the Left of the Gardens, and it was the Air Gardens.
I've seen people in the world of faith and culture, and this experience has become a fundamental subject in my personality.
A lot of comments, interviews in childhood, tried to give me a sense of joint to suffer others, and for me, it's not like I would love to leave other good people, not as much as I would like to make sure I'm going to get old.
It's a sense that allowed me to connect the stereotypes that I've learned in childhood, from experience experience.
And then there was Vaily Sweight, and every night John Skir told me to be a big deal with myself about my own dataman, and he asked me to realize that race, if you're a magician, if you don't have anything in common with your personality.
In a lot of smart ways, he gave me a note that I had so much need.
For example, there's a lot of sensation from where it's not a cup of tea, I'm now aware that my sketches have impacted my glimpse as more powerful than my father's software.
One day I spoke to my mother about how I started to change my freshness, and she told me something that I would hold my heart for my whole life.
And at this point, I realized how much less energy energy is coming out to try to get this gratitude inside of myself.
Zuck Ibrahim isn't my name's name.
I've asked him when my family has decided to fix relationships with men and start life.
So how do I open up my personalities and self-assembly?
Well, that's simple.
Instead, I use my experience to fight against empathy, to fight against data bias.
I've been doing this for smart careers and care for their novels, for the insurance and the insurance they've taken on their floor because they're illiterate.
And in that context, I talk to you about donation of these unseen acts and judgment of my parents' behavior.
I'm here to suggest that violence is not a part of childhood or race, and my son is not supposed to follow the path of his parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you. (Applause) Thank you all of you. (Applause) Thank you very much. (Applause) Thank you very much. (Applause)
But it can't be that way.
I love the guy who loves the nightmare guy.
I learned a long way through these 30-degree challenges.
This is a picture of my challenge when I was doing a picture of the last month.
I've never met a wonderful one.
It's frightening.
In fact, they're more found.
(Applause)
I've been amazed to come to the country who's going to meet the best places in the world to be a woman.
In 1975, when I was seven years old, women in college came out of the book.
At that day, they didn't work, whether they had a business room, whether they just did it.
They would march in the Rak's Center Center — they would have 90 percent of women — and they would go to sardi, and they would say, well, don't care.
None worked in the state of the day, because nothing works when women don't work.
(Applause) Over five years, Islamians have had the courage to be the first nation in the world, which has been disastrous ways to choose women as the president.
I'll never forget that day, when President Vigs, of course, in us and Sudan, came out on the tower of my home, my mother and my daughter, and then she's done it.
(Applause) It's become an extraordinary nodes for me, and every one who's growing up at that time, including a few men.
"She would often tell a story about a boy who would walk up to her after several years of planting, and she would say, ""Well, boys could also be a trader when they grow up?"" (Laughter) The locations really have a lot of value, but even with a lot of powerful advances to explain which I'm very proud to when I was asked to look at the plant of the Greeks, my first time was, "Hould I just like this?""
"Who am I so afraid to be married?"" And as a result, women are less likely to press the plant than men."
The study, we tested in the United States in 2011, and we found that 62 percent of men looked at their country's farmland, but only 45 percent of women.
We see a one-and-a-half percent breakthrough, and that's the same revolution that's been around a decade ago.
It's a real sake, because I'm sure that the world needs women gifts and more leadership in the first place.
So my solution to grading was to see what I was going to need to do in an emergency room, even without a political experience, to go ahead and try to figure out what the world needs to have meaning to be three of our kids that we really let the boy and the men, and the people who want to do what they want to do.
It was the journey of my life.
It was wonderful.
The campus started with 20 major nations in the world.
And then the skill rate was connected to nine in the end, and finally the race went to the chefs, three men and me.
(Applause) But it's not all jam yet.
Well, maybe you'll notice that the United States has a lot of jars here, but I can — (Laughter) I can say that we're in the middle of the United States.
At first, President, in the last 20 years, figured out that he wasn't going to get grades, which perhaps led to that extent in the end of the world.
And then he thought, well, when our press was a Scientist, a pan-African administrator, they were known by the Panama Commissioners who had been lost and his family.
Protection came to a test, and when President said that the country needed a leader.
And a few days later, the connection with his wife and her family was also diagnosed in the Panama Commission, and he went back from his bed again.
Until he said that, as a son, he said it's doing it, because now there are two Kennedy men who can be his year-to-year-old movement.
So, nine tweets, 45 days of choice, looked nothing to me on the right.
I didn't even get a place in a lawn line.
Now, I had one percent, but one of them was the greatest success of women in Afghanistan.
So let me say that I've had the same opportunity to get my place behind the stall and go to the door, because the guy has decided to turn it only in the middle of the world with the 2.5 percent of the voice in the early days.
And the day of these debates, I found that I would never sit there with the two men, and during the trial, I found out that I had gone two and a half percent day in the first debate.
(Applause) And the problem.
The good problems that I've seen and done this way have been connected to the media and the elderly and the graffiti.
Let's talk to the media.
Some say that the whole thing is not about media and politics.
I can't tell you.
And I turned out to be more affordable, and I found an old time in media.
I'm talking about this, and I'm talking about this village of 87 times before I arrived there was 31 times before I was there at the time.
And I don't want to say that media does this work.
And I think the reason why is not so important is because in media, there's a lot of private people, like all over the place, there's an absolute and unconscious mind, and there's a courage to talk about it if we want to make progress.
"When I got access to TB, the first question I ever asked was, ""Do you pay out of your end?"" That was the big question."
And of course, one-and-a-half percent of the voice you can understand.
But the media really matters, and every time I've been at TB, we've seen and we've seen a lot of research, so I don't know how important this is, and why we need to talk about it.
I've had the same time in the world, and I've never been interviewed in the first room.
Sometimes I leave with some of the questions that you've learned all the rest of the world, and because of the idea of choice.
I saw this, but I'm going to tell you a computer from the Islamic media.
There wasn't almost any comments of my recent comments or comments.
(Applause) Honey will be broken.
But there's another really important experience.
I graded how independent law enforcement was, without any politician or any matter of politics.
This kind of experience and help to resources may have gone to our companies, but also let us innovate and do politics differently.
Our company was positive, and we may have changed a ton of choices for others.
That's the reason why I spent a lot of time on TB, because I wanted to show you the other press.
When we have access to the media, it's incredibly complex, we've launched our own information.
I'm on Facebook online, and it's when I'm answering any kind of setup questions.
All of those questions together, we've come up with open Facebook, because we've believed it's important to use when we want to get tired of trust.
When it turned out to be a problem with paying attention to young dollars, I started using Snatchat.
And I was told to do this, and I used every movie from Soundat during the last part of the company.
I was really excited about a lot of hump and rooms, because I'm right here.
But because of that, we have increased the number of individuals in the wild.
And it seems like you can have a company and you can do it in a different way.
Sadly, you can't talk about politics, and you can't talk about money.
That's what it's like, but it's true, and we have less resources than we have in the rest of the world.
Perhaps the reason for that was that, in my opinion, it was time to lie about the apologies.
And maybe I wanted to do more of the men's great things.
Some people say it's very late.
But even with the midst media and the resources, and only with the entrepreneurial team, but the great team, we've been amazed at all day when we've had the first few numbers.
I've seen myself as you can see in a picture.
(Laughter) The flood of the first data, I was walking around in the middle of the story.
(Cheering) Well, too early, because I couldn't win, but I took a long way from one to three parts of my voice, and we tried to test the unprecedented address, which was 10 percent more in the past.
Because of that, some of you will catch me with the true challenge of choice, and a lot of people would ask me to ask me over time.
But in fact, what I'm trying to learn is that I've made a proposal to a more high-frequality perspective on the bridge, and a lot of people have asked me about 2040.
(Applause) She's 13 now, and she's never been on TB.
But on a day of choice, I met her on TB, she was rational, she was confident, she was honest and she kept her mother alive.
It may have been found at the moment of my company's momentum.
(Applause) But there was another one.
Beautiful, a young girl at the end of his childhood saw me walking around on a bus jacket and a gasoline jacketing him.
Announcer: Oh!
This is a picture for me to come.
We can achieve everything we see.
It's the pain and the problems.
(Applause) Janchin's women need it, and it's time for women to get paid, let's let it be gay or civilians.
"I met you too late at New Yorker's ""Newer."" And I had this new thing to do with me, ""It's a smart truth."" (Screaming voice) (Singing) Now, that's my greatest challenge, because women are too often using empathy as I click it, but I know what we're going to do when we're doing that."
(Applause) And we need to use that more.
On the day of choice, we were sinistering, as though we had lost, because we felt like we felt.
It's not true of this leadership.
You just have to go to that, and you, your family and friends, all of you who are going to work with you when you're trying to get a good job, then growing up for everything you've ever experienced.
We've got a good time, and I've learned a lot more about that journey than I can tell you last year.
But thank you, it was a great job.
For nearly those months, I've lost a lot of sleep.
It's still going to be trivial and hard to keep cheese, and I realize that I knew that at the end of the day, you're going to be able to walk only in the case you're paying attention to yourself and the act of being in touch with that voice.
It's like giving my fortune to sit down, and you can get your identity, but it's never under you.
I want to stress too, and you all know this, every time you travel, it's your team.
People who share values and balances, but they're different from others.
For me, it's a form of success, and I've been listening to an amazing man here today, an amazing family, and I'm talking about — (Applause) and great friends, we've come up with entrepreneurs in a political August, and we've shown something about words that people can't do.
"The voice is talking about, the chief team of judgments from publicity said, ""How did I make a decision that would be good when I put seven percent."
And I gave him a picture of this view, because maybe he's right, and he's trying to make sure that he's a remarkable experience.
But one day, I decided to show you that he's wrong.
And it's really important, because I've actually been sleeping very little and working hard like people around me.
We're never going to do a lot if we forget about ourselves.
And I think that's really important two things: stop yourself from people and people on the right, but it doesn't matter if it doesn't anymore, it's hard to resist people, and it's easy to hold your power, and it's wonderful blogs and comments.
And that's what I've been totally passionate about, and I decided not to pay attention to the stories, partly because of my power, my power has gone all the time.
When I had the energy energy at a certain point — and this was an hour from time, because it wasn't easy — I was looking at the benefits of my scores, not just that, but because of my rules.
I called our 4G company, where G's English means an Islamic word.
"The first of them is ""Gregn."" I graded to do it, be sure, I wanted to focus on leadership as the unit of our work in front of the company."
The second word is Gleeni, or joy.
I decided that I would love to go through this journey.
You can get a lot of it, even though it's going to get a second purpose.
And I've come up with all the struggle to make it happen to others.
"The third word is ""Gransni."" I was open to anyone."
I didn't have any books, I couldn't learn anything about Facebook or our gardens.
I think when you choose pressures, you deserve to ask your questions.
In fact, it's less important to the end of this room that we don't have to tell you, we're a big company called Gripwer, and that's the power of power.
(Cheering) I'm really excited that I found courage to get grades to be willing to care about, but to get a lot of nodes.
I can't tell you that it was simple, but I don't know, and I think I've had the whole team left behind it, and it's worth it.
Thank you.
(Applause) Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)
Pat Mitchell: I'm not going to leave you yet, Hall Thomas's: I'm very good listening to you. PM: I can't help you, I haven't told you.
Perhaps everyone in this room is going to drive outside of the room, and they're going to be able to drive for you, and they're going to drive you.
We're not sure if we're going to have a voice there, but there's something we can take in the background as we've never seen before, and that's an inspiration.
I mean, I mean enough to try to remember 1975, when women came out on the street, and it really became a big fan of launching a woman's movement.
You've been sent to this journey earlier, and let's take a look at the picture, and let's look like a country that's walking into a tourist.
And you may not know, because American media didn't talk about it, but you've been staring at the Islamic women again on the street. Right?
HT: Yeah. PM: Can we tell this story?
HT: 41 years from now, we can read the best places in the world to be honest, but our work has gone.
So, I was staring at 148 women in the hallway, because at this point they'd made their own origins every day.
(Applause) So the real challenge was that young women and women made a difference in the world than before, because they lost an hour of leak-in-lawing innovation.
PM: I'm not going to experience Hulu now about her future plans, but I'm going to tell you that you're going to have a big good idea of walking arises when you're trying to do it again.
Thank you, Hall.
HT: Thank you all.
(Applause)
In fact, I've been trying to think about my career since I left the White House, and the best example I've ever done is to the New Yorker a couple of years ago.
"Manny boys, you know, look at me, and they say, ""Well, if I grow up, I want to be an excessant."" (Laughter) I've seen a huge amount of humanity, like President, because I've been able to access the few people in the world who have ever been in the world if I've ever met people with people in the world."
They're going to take care of those rules to make sure that women are usually going to get friendship organizations compared to men in the warehouse of God.
So they've given an argument, which basically, is that women are empowered to be connectors, to deal with charts in a carpenter, or to a partner in archives, when a woman's science in South Central Park, she can't ask if a young woman in a room, because you can find a trustworthy back in a museum, and you can find more than 30,000 people saying that women shouldn't have a male, and so forth.
But the key thing is that writing is wrongly wrong to keep men at a higher level of arm.
Why do I have to pay them such a reward for using the same work?
In the U.S., for example, we've had a huge increase in the flow of poorers, the primary darkness of the people and the mentalities that were used in the prison.
Now, 7.3 people in a few places are in prison.
That's a seven-fold increase.
Since I left the White House, there was an increase in 800 percent dark women in jails.
We're one of the hardest images on Earth, which still has a blind show of the ancient country.
We're in California right now, and I've learned that we've spent four billion dollars trying to report that 13 people have lost track.
One of them is picked up by the tent's orchestras.
Sometimes, in more recent cases, they lower their address so that a young woman can do it.
And then, when she gets married, it's the same time that she's open the address to be sexy.
It's not rare, although it's against law.
So, for example, the 91 percent of all women who live in Evez today have been sexually assured in this way.
In some countries, it's more than 98 percent of women who have had this opportunity to reach.
It's a terrible thing for all women who live in countries.
The other really profound thing is, where family is in the wrong explanation, there's nothing in Quran that says it — is a girl with her family when she's pregnant or when she's married or even when she's wearing her nose.
This is what happens to a family like this, where a family like this, when a young woman comes up with so much shame in her family.
Not so long ago, ANC has been tested in the Embassy, and he showed that 75 percent of those women are working on smallpoxs, grandparents, 25 percent of their women' rights.
The world's global problem is about slavery, or human trafficking, as it's called now.
About 12.5 million people were released in New Year in the 18th century and in the 18th century.
Thirty million people live today in slavery.
The United States Department has the capacity to give up on the right every year, and the Open Department has been able to communicate through international limits of every year, 80 percent of the women who spend in sexuality.
In the United States, it's this moment in the United States, 60,000 people live under their claws or their slavery.
Attolitan, George, where there's the Media Carster, and where I'm going to introduce you to Emanra, between 200 and 300 women.
That's the place one in the country because of that.
Attlanz, there's also a lot of plantations around the world.
If a boroughman wants to cook a little girl who's struggling with it, they can do it for a billion dollars.
The girl's voice comes up with a tower in Alanza, and she's able to get about 3,000 grains from the wound.
Setho-government in Alanz, George Georgia.
This is coming to one of the biggest issues, women are bought and sold around the world.
Sweden has a good approach to this.
Forty-two years ago, Sweden decided to change the law, and women no longer manage the law if they're in sexual slavery, but they're the customers of the tower, the judgment, and — (Applause) — the government went back to the office.
The United States is in the United States.
One man, in the last 25 women, was scaled in the U.S.
Canada, Irlandic, I already said, Sweden, France and other countries are moving right now.
It's another one on the right that can be done.
We have two big grades in the country, our arches and a great social system.
It's analyzed by archetypes.
And lastly, what I've done is tell you what happened in the artisan — let's give you a few.
Only 3,000 people, and the reason for that is that teams of any organization — the Arab boat, or the elbow in March five — my team has a right to think about the narrowing rule of compassion, and of course, the people who want to believe they don't do it this way, they don't.
This law needs to change.
The North Service says, in test scores, there's been a huge decline because because of a university system, when they're assaulted to someone, but when they're caught in a college campus.
They don't get distracted.
These are things that happen in our society.
When I became president, the difference was 39 percent.
So we've gone back to every progress, and so on — (Applause) — (Laughter) — but in the last 15 years, it was only about 23 or 24 different stories in the last 15 years.
That's what's happening now.
If you take 500 companies, 23 of their women's neighbors, from 500, and these leaders in the morning, I'll tell you, they're under less leadership.
That's what's happening in our country.
The other problem is that we're the most vaginous nation on Earth.
We found ourselves in the war in the future, almost since World War II.
Often our salads were at the place of the towers.
In the same together, we've been pulsing on a gallon, and we've got to get rid of the people.
Sometimes, of course, we now have drones.
We were in the war of 25 different countries, more than World War II.
For hours of age, I won't tell you which we didn't vary — (Applause) — we didn't know any pain, we didn't suffer.
But in any case, those things, in other cases, against violence and the wrong way, are the major pollination of women over women.
The other handful of reasons, Agam, men to clap.
(Applause) It's true.
Especially a man who can say it's just a nice thing to acknowledge, it's very similar to when I was a mother, when I was division and still a superintelligence.
But over the course of this time, there were a lot of white people who didn't think that discrimination would happen, but they would silence, because they would have been able to have long-run-to-to-packed, high school schools and all the rest of the rest, and that's what's happened today, because there's a real male, actually.
"In fact, when they say, ""I'm against discrimination, they're using an exclusion."
I'm the key thing we have to do today?
I would say the best thing that we could do for women with powerful vision like this, and where you come from, Europe and so on, who has the capacity to take responsibility for ourselves to be more movement-building to endeavor in the world around the world.
But I hope that after this session, women believe their husband's assaults in college campuses and in archives, and in the marketplace, they need to protect their caregivers and their privacy.
I've got 12 kids and 10 honest children, and I often think about them, and the gadgets are not only if they've lived in the Embassy, and I hope all of you will join me to be the champions for women around the world, and to protect their people.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
When I was a student here in Oxford in the 1970s, the future of the world looked like arose.
The population's growth was not stopping.
The World Health Organization was broken.
Academy of cancer caused by prosecutors in the wild, managed to reduce our lives.
The Chinese dose is right down the forest.
Nathan had passed away, and I found a scrapy bear in the middle of the day.
In the middle of my life, I spent 30 percent.
The child's death is less than two-thirds.
Growing food for a generation of people grew up to be growing up.
Take a look at a couple of populations, and this graph shows the GDP per population per population.
In other words, you need to understand how ideas are sexy.
So I want you to imagine what we've done from creating these products to create these kinds of things.
And of course, there were some changes, but the app changes slowly over the years.
It's an amazing festival, but it's true.
That hour, on the right, it's boasting in five years.
And more than that, from a variety of different ideas, the ideas of plasma, the ideas of lasers, the ideas of logistics.
They were connected together in this technology.
And this is a transformation, and it's a collection of technology that I've got, because I think it's a key to knowing what's going on in the world.
Your body is also a collection of ideas: the idea of tactile beds, the idea of the brain, the idea of the sand.
They came together.
How do you evolve things that are common or sensitive?
She uses a tenth of failure.
One thing you'll notice is that there's another one.
A species in a room that could probably get people to a stand-by-and-a-half mutation in different ways.
So it's sexy that allows a human to mimic the generic innovation of all species.
It doesn't last to its own growth.
So this is the process that has this effect in the cultural revolution that's sexy in my biological evolution?
I think the answer is a paramute, a hazard of one thing.
It's a human human race fish.
No bees don't do that.
Maybe be the essence of a culture.
Liberty is a culture. It has a culture.
They teach one of the traditional people who interrupt parents from our parents.
Symmetry is a diverse culture in many different ways.
They don't have any idea.
So why would life gifts increase?
The answer came from Davidiana in 18177.
And write him think of it in a version of the Campaign, which he also said in the Gulf of the country.
And Adam comes in the wild in four hours and a sitcom for three hours.
It's produced by the wild in one hour, and it's sitting in two hours.
It's the best Adam in the mouth and the sitner, and the wild.
I don't have Adam.
He can do his own wildlife and his sitcoms.
Adam and Oz and Ozen were late at an hour of his time.
When you first start, you have to drive in a village.
How many of you have this zoo? It's time for a lot of time.
How many are you going to work for an hour on top of your reading when you're born in the UK?
The Web on the right was made for me by other people.
How many exactly did you do it?
Are you alone? Are you alone?
You know, I think millions of people.
And that's how society works.
That's what we're finding as a biological species.
Earlier times, when you've been wealthy, people literally have worked for you.
Forty-98 people would pay him to dinner every day.
In fact, there are other animals working on one another.
Moof is a classical example.
The bottom left is the answer for jumping.
(Applause) When did that happen?
But I don't have a clue to that.
And the beauty of this system is that it's enabling the rest of it or the base.
And he knows he doesn't have to drop out to athletic cables.
They were high-performance visions.
They were very intelligent.
But there's no evidence that their room has been shared with work.
There's no evidence for a number of women.
It looks like women grew together with men.
There's also no witnesses on the other side of the group, because we've seen alleged alphets of the Tunisia Games, the tools that they've always been done with local materials.
For example, there's a place in Kahlakas, where they've been found by local equipment in Hospital.
They've always been made with a local talent.
When a man started to shout out things like this, it's a way of being told that they've collapsed between groups.
That's a decade ahead of domestic violence.
And this is where some 80120,000 years ago in Africa, where we see that nasty, Imish and other things about a long distance from Enjoyment.
Also, it's like, you know, it's been invented here in Oxcode, and it's 200 kilometers away from the mask from the North Atlantic.
And that's evidence that groups of people started parameters.
And this led to a skillful approach.
What happens when you limit people from the paramount, from the ability to be able to care and skill?
The answer is, it's not just about putting technology forward, but it can even get it to the other direction.
Let's bring this to you, it's a big deal.
The dance was exhausted.
So back to you and ask yourself, not just who's done it for someone, but who knows how to do it?
None of them literally don't.
"I'm, of course, a quote by the Lebanese Elephant, economist 1950s, called ""I, Allean,"" where he said, ""I'm making a book like a cockroach, and nobody knows how to do it, because people don't know how to fix it, and they don't know how to cut trees and how to scale it."
What we've done in the modern society, the path of apathy and skill — we've created an opportunity to do things that we don't even understand.
It's not the same as the language.
In fact, I'm not interested in the deficits of a level of personality, or I'm interested in some groups of more than IQ groups than other groups.
It's absolutely not my knowledge.
In society, it matters how people get their ideas, and how good they get, not how smart one person is.
We've created a collective brain.
We're just nodes in serves.
We are the neurons of this brain.
Subsequent ideas, met, and the movement of ideas is one of the rights of technological advances, enabling a step by step.
You're not as much as you're seeing and bad things.
In the future, as long as we move forward, we're going to be able to experience things.
They're going to be warriors, depression, natural rockets.
The worst things happened in this century, I'm absolutely confident.
Thank you.
