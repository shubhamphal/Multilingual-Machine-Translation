I was 11 years old, and in one of my children, I remember being happy in our house, or something that I could enjoy in our house.
My father listened to the BBC news in his little radio radio.
There was something that he knew at the time that we had never used, because the news was a lot of people who were missing it.
"""The father's been haunted back!"" — my father was winter."
I didn't realize what that meant, but I couldn't see how my father was happy.
"He said, ""You can go to the actual school,"" he said, ""You know, my dad."
It was a morning I could never forget.
The real school is going to school.
When I went to Afghanistan, I was six years old, when girls had a school, they had no school.
So, in the next five years, I had to go out and make clothes like a boy to go to a secret school, if we were to just go out and do one thing.
We've been the only way we've ever been able to get education.
Every day, we've made it a different way, and we've never thought about where we're going.
We're going to bend our books into market, and it's just like we've gone.
She's in a school, she's 100 percent of a school, and she's like a guy's got a petridge in a small pocket.
It was comfortable during time, but it would be cool on the spring.
We all know that teachers and students and parents — we're all missing our lives.
Sometimes, Tal would have connected a week from school because he'd never thought he'd be happy.
We were always afraid of what we knew about our rights.
What do I see? What about us?
Do they know where we are?
We were terrible, but yet, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was actually very lucky, because I grew up with a family where I grew up and counted his daughters in love.
My father was an amazing person to see the course of his life.
She insisted that she had a different thought in Afghanistan, a girl, a girl, a mother, to school in Afghanistan, and that even her father had been dismissed by her father.
But my mother had trained.
It's it.
Two years ago, she was born, and she turned our house into a school for girls and women.
And my father — this is what — he was the first one to have been trained in his family.
She didn't know if she could get girls to school, even though her children were going to get educated, even though she'd gotten a lot of trouble, she'd get risks.
For him, their children were more dangerous to not get educated.
I remember, I'd come back in the old years, and I'd like to think about it, from our life, from being in fear, and seeing light from the future.
"And my father said, ""Listen, my daughter, you can lose anything in her life."
You can have a battery-built plant. You can put it in the winter, and you can put it in order to leave your house.
But the only thing that's going to happen with you is there, and if you're going to sell your blood to pay for school spending, you're going to sell it to school, you're going to sell it to school.
"Now, as a matter of fact, do you keep doing it still?"" I'm 22 today."
I grew up in a country that had been distributed in war for decades.
I couldn't do it, but only six percent of my life knows about middle school, and if my family didn't look for my education, I couldn't do it.
Instead, I'm here, and I'm here, and I'm convinced that there's a Mumblebury Court in front of you.
(Applause) When we went back to the hospital, one of the first people that made me care, it was the essence of the day when she sent her daughter to school.
She's not because I'm graduate, but because I'm the first woman to walk around with cars in small areas.
(Applause) My husband believes me.
I have a lot of dreams, and my family is bigger, and my dreams are bigger.
So, I'm the diameter of a global campaign called 10x10, where women are an assistant of education.
That's because, in a country where women are still risky for schooling, I can't get SOLA, which is the first schools in Afghanistan.
And that's the most glimpse of what I'm seeing in the schools, is the dominant students who have access to the possibilities.
And I see how their parents support their ancestors, their ancestors, my father, even though they come out to me, and they support their daughters.
I don't know what it's like. I can't tell you the faces and the real name of her, but she's the father of one of my students.
About a month ago, when her daughter and her sister were able to describe her village village, she had them die on the road a couple of minutes before she died.
She played the phones on the house, and the voice on the phone would continue to send her daughter to school, and she would be able to go back and forth.
"And he said, ""If you want to kill me now,"" he said, ""I'm not going to protect my daughter's future if you're going to go back, and I'm not going to protect my old ideas."" What I've discovered about Afghanistan is that sometimes the success of a girl who has been observed by Westerners — and it's based on the success of the success of a girl behind us."
That doesn't mean that our students don't have the successes.
In fact, their ancestors are the vast majority of the main people who persuade girls to be brilliant and oriented, but in a community like this one, the support of men in a community, in a community.
There were hundreds of numbers of people who were going to school — you know, there were hundreds of numbers of people who were getting to school.
And now, we're more than three million girls going to school in Afghanistan.
(Applause) Look at Afghanistan from the United States, it looks very different.
I understand that Americans see unrelatedness in the world.
I'm afraid we're not going to take these changes long after the U.S. military.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, we see children and parents who are encouraged to support them, I believe in a light future and a change that will happen all the time.
So, for me, girls from Afghanistan are in countries of hope and limitations, and girls from SOLA are going to give me a more moment every day.
They accumulate big dreams like me.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
It's a branch that admires meaning, admires meaning.
There's lost in the Arkillan.
It doesn't make it happen. Let's go back.
One. Two. Three.
We're going to see the first public sector.
If there was no wonder about anything.
And yet, I was so lucky for running out of it, so many North Korea, so fortunate that I had not been so lucky.
After learning a new language, when it gets work, all its life could be sub-tractive at once.
We all lived in Korea, but after six7 years of fragmentation, we were all divided.
Am I from South Korea or North Korea?
So I started planning about saving them.
I'll never know anybody.
That's the picture of my life then.
This is Yughai, which we designed in 2004.
We've built it into rice.
Staying through the inside of the building.
If you're a kid, you probably know that kids love to throw it out.
That's what the building looks like.
Why did we build this?
"And he said to me, ""I don't want people to be."
"And I said to him, ""It's not possible."" But he insisted, ""Well, how do you do a trace from the edges of my life?"
"They're going to get up to kids."" (Laughter) I said to him, ""That's okay."" And of course, the government workers said, ""Suhrahers must be absolute."
And we've done this idea, but we've done it around the trees.
There are three trees inside the building.
They allowed us to call these scores.
But it's used for complete purpose.
They put them on the tuna.
And the kids are doing what they're doing.
(Laughter) Sometimes you put a child around the trees, and it's about four children.
This guy, you see on thisqa, he likes this tree so much that he's eating it.
(Laughter) Every time you get a lecture, they sit beyond the roof.
It looks very fresh than that.
They look like lpoopar fruits.
(Laughter) It's time for me.
(Laughter) (Applause) We've done my life as far as possible, but we're not just below the roof, but we're also trying to see it.
It's very high, but it's very high in the ceiling.
And that's where it's here to eat legs — every species has a water crystal.
You can see that the environment wants to water your friends in children, and that's okay.
But what you're seeing is that the boy loses the krancheta, they're able to fill them with water.
(Laughter) Over the course of the last year, it's completely open.
There's no sky inside, no desert.
And that means that the archetype is actually the stain of the arc.
There are no skydives between the classrooms.
There are no problems.
And when I'm staying down most of the kids, they start to dishearse.
But there's no reason why, in this case, we're not going to get angry.
Because there's no sky there.
"He's going to tell me, ""If a boy standing in the corner doesn't want to be in the room, you can go out and go to the room."
It's moving around, and it's going to go back and forth.
(Laughter) I mean, they often like to hide.
And here they go and come back again.
And that's natural.
Second, we think that sound-made is very important.
You know, kids get better on the sound.
They're everywhere. They're not lying together.
We're looking at a high-speed immigration in our children.
You know, our ancestors have grown up in the sound-to-face faces.
It has to sound to them.
Also, you know, I'm not easy to talk to your friends — you know, I can't talk to you anywhere.
You don't have to be neat.
You know, in our lifetime, we're trying to control everything.
This is OK.
We know that in winter, in winter, we can go to the 00 degrees of cold.
And then we're trying to hurt it.
It's getting sunmered in 50 degrees.
We don't get water.
We're not a husband in the rain.
So we've evolved to become a flag.
We have to act like this as children.
It's trying to divide it into a classroom.
They're actually going to help teachers.
But they don't.
(Laughter) And this kid is sitting there.
That's the classroom.
This is the hand-built.
So they're having a good conversation.
There are more trees in this room.
He's trying to keep the fruit on the top of the fruit.
(Laughter) More fruit. (Laughter)
In every classroom's office's office, there's no pavement.
Santa Cullus comes from a mile.
And that's built in addition, and it's built right next to the circus.
It's going to be five meters tall, and it's seven feet tall.
Because we're very low.
We need to have a feeling that's safe.
A girl allows a boy to let it go.
It's trying to get inside.
It's likely to do it.
Well, but it's a good thing to do.
It's powerful. It's my son.
(Laughter) Here we see how safe it is that we can move out of the trees.
Then we left other kids inside.
You know, there's going to be a lot going on in Tkoki.
(Laughter) She's trying to learn how to drive the driver.
Now, even though there's a little bit of danger in the middle of the child.
So they're learning how to help each other.
It's a community, and we can hand these kinds of possibilities.
This drawing shows a boy from 9.0 to 9.30 in the 1960s moving towards a child's direction.
It's 183 meters in the studio.
It's not too small.
So this little morning, he made six mini meters of roads.
But what's interesting is it's already happened.
These guys are moving at 4,000 meters a day.
These kids here have the highest athletic display of their relationships.
"And the wrist always says, ""I don't know how to do them. I don't have them."
"We drop it on the floor."" (Laughter) They run away for their own." (Laughter)"
I think they don't need to control them, and we don't need to know very much, but they have to go all over them.
They've got to get a lot of rice.
Because it's going to teach them how to live in life.
I thought that architecture can change the world and the lives of people.
This is one of the steps that children have taken to change lives.
Thank you.
(Applause)
In the 1970s, I spent two years in the city of China in India.
I had a chance that I could pay all the money to go to a school in the first grade to teach the athletic school.
"But my mother said, ""Yox."" And my parents wanted me to be an engineer like them."
And it was the only way that I realized after the Indqilaba, that there was a good income and a safe job to be happy.
I don't love my work — it doesn't matter.
But my dream of China was to become freedom.
I'm playing the piano this way.
I wanted to be involved in the world of young people, and I wanted to go to Opera to school to go to school.
I even wrote a letter to give our school school students a radio show.
But I didn't really like my idea.
Nobody believed that I'm not a big deal.
But my friends would support me, and they were children like me.
So I realized that it was night to study 15 years old.
My wish never happened.
Like the end of my life, I was afraid I would be the only happy one in my second grade.
But that was injustice.
I decided to make some other things.
Nobody's going to tell me it's going to do it? No Ebola.
I applied to books.
"I did this book that I said to my grandmother, who was a musician family, who said, ""Fou Lei's writing about his family.""] And I took all the women's all the women's women's women's women's women's women's women's women's women's women's women's women's women's women's women's women's women's models from this book. [Jenny Elephor."" (Laughter) (Applause) And I was asked by this book."
"[""Sanmao-Animo's Archo Chan""] [""The courses of Echo""] [""The authors from Tiblan: When Nan Huaijin] I first read books when I came to the United States in 1995?"
Of course, they were not able to do it.
"It's about the village of ""The Great Tunis,"" which is about life."
There's no use for propaya. I've come to understand it.
The Bible is interesting, and it's a little strange.
(Laughter) That's the challenge of another day.
"But my fifth brother has enlightened me. He says, ""You're going to respect the father and the mother."" And he says, ""You're going to respect the mother."
"And I thought, ""He's different and better than Jesus."" So I'd be able to redesign my parent's relationship from the sons of Confuti, in this way, from the feeling of guiltyness in the Defense of Defense."
It allowed me to compare what I'd read when I met a new civilization.
This can teach you a lot.
For example, this map seemed strange to me when it was first, because in China, we grew up learning this map.
I'd never thought that China would not be living in the middle of the world.
In fact, the map actually shows the look at the world.
It's not something new about interventions.
This is a standard practice in science around the world.
In fact, there's a lot of science here, like science and scientists like Himisis and Species.
It's helping scientists and scientists understand exactly the understanding of this.
And I thought, well, if it works for exploration, why don't it work in everyday life?
So I started reading books in a dictionary.
"[""Benjamin Franklin""] [""Joto Isacons""] [""John Man""] David Maclo Shouldh] and the same part of the story, whether it's about friends."
"[""The writer Katarine""] [""Qartopea: This is a writer of Warf and his life called ""The Sachine Schrove""]""] I love to read a story a couple of jars — (Laughter) [Man Jambers Verruncirus""]""] [""The king Christopher""] Jamberberberberberepo writes ""The Chamberberberepridge""] [""The same story as Josbusseepler's ""The Brusp.""] In his great story, Josbusp, Joscottelz, in his collection, Joseph."
For the prophecy, these were economic, political and souls.
I'm interested in this Buddhist, these are all psychologists: the lack of compassion, the social responsibility, the social capital that we have.
I'm also interested in reading two languages that you love if you like a language.
"[""Chauang Tzuken: Toamel Merton""] [""Of course: Watts""] The writer: The Watts""] I found other interesting things that he couldn't push, but other things."
"Now, I realized that translation means ""happiness"" in China, which means ""happy"" in English."
"It's called the word ""the mother."" Yes!"
(Laughter) Over the past few books, I've been playing a magic palace role that I can connect with people in our time.
I could never be alone or without power again.
It doesn't matter if you want it to happen, because you don't want it to do it with the difficulties of other people.
I started to believe that the only purpose of the desire wasn't to happen.
The point of wish is that aspirations allow us to connect with a point of interest and happiness.
And the desire that we can't do that too.
Because books are because I'm here today, and I'm happy, and I'm living in a very long way with an enlightened purpose.
"And I'm like, ""Hell you all."
Thank you.
(Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)
You wouldn't mean that. We would do it.
"You're going to see yourself in your personal room and ask me, ""Why is my style?"" Well, you're on the morning and you're in office, and then suddenly you're on your board."
And I'm talking about something much more worth than office myths.
From the bottom, from your age.
(Laughter) And I think it's important to get people to think about it as a result of the original meeting of the Sunday. (Laughter)
"It's a Qual-Africane regime — well, click, click, click, click, ""I'm going to go ahead, I'm going to hear it."" (Laughter) I think the sounds are important, right?"
In every company, the company has a success.
And a meeting that's going on is really good.
We're okay. (Laughter) It's not because that guy's not going to be able to get a good meeting, DRS, you know, the Riculation Strin, you know, is what we've created.
Actually, I have evidence that DRS-E is global epidy.
So, let me tell you about it.
A few years ago, I put a video on YouTube, and I've been able to do all sorts of bad things that you can do in this video.
It's about five-minute video meetings that combine everything we hate to know.
Here's the head of a meeting that allows us to run, and that's what we can do.
They're not going to know what to do.
And everybody left him in a nasty way.
It's about having to laugh.
(Laughter) Let's look at the sounds quickly.
(Video) That's what we've come to believe in a very important issue.
Hi, Joe is. I'm working in the house today.
(Laughter) Hi, Joe. Thank you for being annoyed.
As a group — listen frozen — (Laughter) Hi, who went to join?
No? I thought we'd come up with it. (Laughter) What about it?
Yes, it's also coming to me.
A few weeks after they put this on YouTube, they were 500,000 people in the country, literally, looking at this video.
And then three years later this video looks at it every month.
Even when they're not able to do it, they'll laugh when they hear the person's voice.
"I'm my Mayl Shermer. I'm the one of the people in Skeppler, the ""Skeptic,"" the governor of the Technologies."
We study abnormal phenomena, amazing groups and peculiar phenomena. These are things like science, wonderful, wonderfulo-melm, unpleasant science, science, Vu-melm, explosive science, science, science and science, and science, and science, and so forth.
And if we've lived on Mars for the past time, then you've encountered these things as well.
Some of them are more likely to call us a ruler.
But let's suppose there's a lot of stuff that's been taken.
We're going to launch the Indian Indian government, we're going to launch them, we're going to get them out. We're the Ralph Nyorder of bad ideas. (Laughter) We're going to change the good ideas with the bad ideas.
Let me show you an example of the bad idea.
I've brought it to myself. We've tried this to try NBC Date Angeline.
In Vircina, a company called Quadro is the product of a company.
"It's called ""Quadro 2,000 Axtarles""."
(Laughter) They sold it to the school administrators 900 dollars.
And Radio Shacken is something that's very smooth.
It can be used to look for lots of things, but it's something that you're looking for in the students' classrooms.
(Laughter) So it works like this: If Kididan is on the other side of this, you'll open a joke.
It's something like this.
I'm going to show you.
(Laughter) Hmm. This tends to go back to a few lines.
And because we're trying to do this again, we're going to try it again.
Well, obviously, it's going to go to this place.
(Laughter) Mr. Teszler, but you've wished your pockets. (Laughter)
Of course, that's the question: Is it possible that the instrument knows that it's a submissioner?
And the answer is, yes, if you open up the hat, then you find it.
(Laughter) (Applause) Not only did we find our hands, but we should follow our tapes.
And here's what I'm going to talk about, and that's what it's like: Estraces, neurologists and lines always use it.
People remember what they're finding, they're forgetting tapes.
We're doing everything. We're doing it at random, compared to the number of purpose and the purpose.
And here we did.
We took two boxes, and we put them in front of a THC constituency, and we put one blank.
And 50 percent of the trials have succeeded. (Laughter) And we're going to get this result.
This was an interesting little example of what we're doing.
"The journal ""Skeptic"" is published in about three months, and there's one thing that's published."
It's about the future of consciousness.
And as often as people do, don't mind?
I've got a sense of what I'm thinking about, and that's what it looks like when people get crazy, they're crazy.
Every decade, the average IQ 3 numbers increase.
And it's interesting.
Don't think of statistic or scientific funding as something.
Elm and religion are they on a blend?
It's like asking the science fiction block to ask.
These are two different things.
It doesn't matter, it's activity.
It's a way to think about things.
We're going to look for nature for all of the phenomies.
"What is more real? What is it that intelligence and super-dimensional creatures come from the Earth, from the other galaxy, from the other galaxy, to the forest of the Fermer Bobobun Kanzas, to the ad?"
"Is it that one of the readers of ""Skeptic"" were able to do this with Photoshop?"
But the question is, what is the more truth?
We have to make sure that we don't have the world before we know what it is to do.
"What would it be more real? What would it be like if Arnold was helping alien peppers to be tornubborn?"" Wouldn't it be that the accident of ""Weard Weekles News"" didn't get that?"
(Laughter) And so things like this include the equivalent of Sydney Harris's profits.
"I read for those who sit now, ""Sonra gives you a wonderful title."
"I think you've got to explain the second battery."" This slide ruins all the smart design arangles."
That's what the anticatus is doing.
(Applause) You can say BASERR from MCCZ, but that doesn't explain anything. It puts an idea in the middle.
It's not going to happen.
For the creationists of the original design, this is the end of the invention.
"People say, ""You're a kiss, sometimes unhappy things are called dark energy, dark matter."" And yet, they say, ""Well, what's wrong with it."
This is the beginning of the logical armor of science.
And that's for the original TRFDARLARARAREI, which is the end-of-the-box ring.
Again, the same question is: How much more real is it?
UFO-FOs is an alien automobile, or is it a deconstructive machine?
This is the UFO image of my home in Altan California, one of my homes.
Doesn't it look like a cup of coffee? Because it's just like a door.
"The go ""Photoshop,"" the high-tech, not the computer."
"I photographed this image with the ""Katk Instematic"" book."
Everyone was ready to walk in a door.
The camera was ready — that's it.
(Laughter) You might think most of them are real, or some of them, or some of them are real, but they're pretty likely to keep it all.
If we take more common, we always look at the variation between the observers and the theme.
For example, the Galiley telescope had two problems with Saturn.
First, there was no contact about planetary rings.
The second thing was that hold the observers and that's what we see, and that's why it didn't really understand what it sees.
"And this is what he wrote about: "I found that there were three pictures of the planet that I've made of.""
And he decided that it was.
So you can't be able to build a good planetary rings, without the contact of the rings, without the compositions.
That's what it did with 1655.
This is a page of a book that Christian Huygens tried to deal with.
We found two things to the Huygens. There was a good theme about the rings and the solar system, and there was more precise telescopes available, so we were able to see that the laws of Kepler blow up faster than Saturn.
We've also seen the tip of the telescope with this telescope.
And that proved the theme.
The bad thing about the country is that it's full of scientific journals.
And one of the reasons why people are looking forward is that we've only realized that it's happening, and then I'll give you a lot of serious reasons.
We don't haze things everywhere.
This is the sadness on Mars.
In 1977, NASA was taken from NASA to the same place, and people thought it was in the albi that it was created by magnets.
Here's a picture taken closer in 2001.
If you're naked, you can distinguish the sadness again.
If you look at your eyes, you're going to turn your image into a more visual image, so you reduce the quality of the data.
And I'm not sure you should look at it, but you'll see it sad, because we've evolved and adapted to recognize the grapes.
Journalists matter to us in social terms.
And of course, they're laughing. They're easy to see all kinds of grapes.
Here you see the smile on Mars.
(Laughter) If the Astronomics were able to build, they would see Kermiti in the Independence.
All right. You see the mouths of the little building?
Or if the geologists had elephants.
They're iconic.
(Laughter) In 1996, Tenessee is a quarter.
He would take five dollars from people who wanted to see a prisoner, until Rahinz and his writings were around Terrorism.
Here's Guillape and Watsonville, down there. What if it wasn't down there?
Now, this is a very nice thing to do, because they have a pattern-based, mesh-buppy, network-barararasis, and they're like these pictures that you're looking for on the screen — people who are animals that are invisible to look at this picture.
This is on the outside of the window of Sao Paula, and I'm on the edge of the window.
Here he's looking at a shower in the sky. I've known this in Las Veegas. Yes, it's America.
(Laughter) Kazino pays 500 dollars a year to take this year from eBay. (Laughter)
Now, don't you think it's happening? Don't I have a bomb? (Laughter)
It's a puncture of Daggas, the 1940s.
I'm on the side of Clearwater, Florida Florida.
I went to see this as myself.
There were so many people.
With handbags, we have a lot of faith in the trees that we have in their hands.
We were more interested in more and more closely.
You know how size — this is Dawkins, and I and great Randi, and we're based on two and a half-quarters view of high school.
People are disgusted by thousands of people.
We went to the back and looked at the back to try to figure out what was going on.
There's a picture that we've created in place where you've got money and palm trees.
This is the scene on the side of the Bakakar. They started to make it.
However, most of the people in a bar can be wonderful.
(Laughter) Now, this is the place that we're doing now, or Marge? (Laughter)
So I'm going to close with another example of this, and I'm going to close my talk with this.
"There's a film called ""Honey sound,"" talking about Maykl Kitton, talking about dead people talking to us."
When I think about dead, I think it's not really big enough to talk about it.
Turns out, everybody knows you're talking.
It's a question of tough dead people.
(Laughter) In this movie, these text messages hide in the electronic events.
I loaded them up from a count called ReverseSpeech.com.
This is one of the most famous.
This is the same sound of this famous lady's voice.
(Maybe words) If there's translation in green, I don't worry.
The summer of May Keein is the source of clean.
You'll have time to change the path, even though there are two pathways.
Now, let's turn it down. Can you hear the hidden message here?
(Music) [Satan] [Satan] ... Hey.
(Music) What were you equal? Audience: Hey!
Hey? You've heard at least about it.
Now I'm going to say what you have to do to the equity of your brain, and we're going to be able to hear again.
I'm going to finish my mind with a tiny, fresh story.
"""Skeptics"" is an organization that's extraordinary."
We're looking for people's goodness.
In Britain, there's a population creation.
It's very famous in Britain: It's called Katie Moolua.
He's got very penalty music.
"It was among the top five songs in 2005, and it was called, ""The Yuquz a million bike bike."" The story of love is that the boy in Britain, Norah Jones — even the boy he loved."
In the words, there's a part of it.
(Music) We're 12 billion light years away from now. That's what it's like. Nobody can say it's true. But I can tell you that I'm in charge of you.
Spiker: All right. At least close numbers.
"It would be that we're six years away from now, like, ""We are."" (Laughter) My friend Simon Singing, the size is physical. It's scientific plaque, and it's a book called ""The Great Party."" And it's a scientific score, and it's a scientific score, and it's a scientific score, and it's a scientific book, and it's an opportunity to make sense of science."
"So, Katie, in ""The Guardian,"" he wrote a paper about the music of Katie, and he emphasizes that we can see how far away we are from the front."
Not 12, 13,7 billion light years away, and that's not the case.
We know how fast it is to do a small probability, even though it's a small probability.
So, if it's not completely accurate, we can say that it's very close to good competition.
What you do is, after the wrist, Katie called him, and we say, I'm very embarrassed, I'm a scientist of astronomical people.
I had to keep on the bed. He also wrote his Mahatma.
And I end my talk with this.
(Music) We're 13,7 billion light years away from the front of the universe that's blocked.
It may be a rule of error, but that's the closest number we've been able to do.
And I'm going to do the data that we have in our hands, and I'm going to predict that I'm always going to be with you.
(Laughter) But isn't it?
(Applause)
In the 1980s, if we had written in communist German in the 1980s, you had to get it down.
Here's an example of a text text that was written in the cave.
And the government knew the randomness of all the scripts.
When they found a piece of paper that made sense, they knew that it was interesting.
And we've been thinking about this in the Western world as a huge loss of self-assemblyness.
We would never let it happen in our own countries.
But this day in 2011, when you've done it all together, you've done it, and you've done it, and you've done it every single web and you've got it, and you've got to be able to realize that there's only one of you on a page that belongs to your translator, and there's a flat left-hand view of the yellow dots that are different from each other.
This is the reality of today.
Nobody puts it in love.
This is an example of the technology of our government, and it's one of the things that we use to our citizens.
This problem is one of three main online problems.
If you look at the problems that are happening, we see online cells that the groups are involved in.
These guys divide into three main groups.
First, online online are copper murderers.
It's like Dmmitri Golubov, who is from Ukraine's Kieval city.
And it's not very hard to understand why people online don't get copied and copying can't do it.
These guys are making money.
They're online to get a lot of money out of tears.
In fact, we've seen millions of cells online, multimedia people.
This is the Vladir Tassta from the East Coast in Tartu.
This is Alberta Gonzalzz.
This is Stephen Watt.
This is Bjorn Sunin.
This is Matthew Anderson, and it's Al-Daur.
These guys are online, but they're doing this online, and they're using things like banking virus to make money out of our online computing, or they're using a computer that's used to online, and they're using a button-to-shaped programmers to collect information.
Two months ago, the U.S. secret service department in this picture was free to calculate the Switzerland bank, and when it was in the language, there were 14,9 million Us full of America.
Nobody knows where it is, and nobody knows where it is.
I think this day, when you're online, we're more likely to be able to build hominids than the real world.
And it turns out that it's worse, even though it gets worse.
In the future, some of the people who are suffering will be online.
The second big group of cells that have been doing this is not money.
There may be no idea, no idea, no idea, no matter what makes them see.
The groups like Antonymus have grown up in the last year and started to place the cells online.
I counted two of the three main guys: the women who do this work for money, like Anonymus, who do this work for business, are groups like erectous, and for instance, the government and governments.
Let's look at companies like DigiNotar.
This is an example of what happens when governments are attacking their citizens.
DigiNotar was an NGO in I'm in Hollar — it was more accurate.
Over the past year, they've gone from being attacked online.
Someone put it into their system and collapsed the whole system.
And just last week, when I asked the Dutch government to come up with this, I asked one of them to believe that the DigiNotiralians, the DigiNot market, caused the death of humanity.
He said he believed it.
How would it be that people are dying from such a cell?
DigiNot is online Saturn.
They sell 10 Sertifiates.
What do they do with cybercriminals?
If you have a letter on Htttps-up, and you want to use this SSL encryption in a series of emails, if you want to use it on a SSL encryption.
We're using emails and services like this, but they're much more famous in the countries like Iran, and many of us, many of them, and many of them, in these countries, are more likely to use foreign services like the Records, because SSL has been encrypted as well as SSL, and they can't be able to control government emails.
But this surveillance is the external Serifatics that offer services like this.
You can distribute the page on the phone.
That's what happened to the DigiNotar company.
What about the Arab Bahir and the Spring, the Missir?
In fact, in the April of 2011, the rebellers in the middle of the secret police, and when you're looking for the B, they've gone through multiple documentaries.
"And among these papers, there was a whole series of things called ""FINFISHER."" And in this case, there were German self-assembly signatures, and the government of Miris sold software and software to keep surveillance under the networks of the government of the government."
The government of this survey sold 20,000 Euros to the government.
The center of the company is right here.
So Western governments are providing governments with devices that allow them to control their citizens.
But Western governments are also paying attention to their citizens.
For example, a few weeks ago, there was a virus that they called the German Government Government Foundation, and this was created by the German government to explain their citizens.
It turns out that if you're a punishable person, you're all people, your phone is listening to.
And now it's more than that.
It will follow our connection.
They can use your own computer to control your entire relationship, they know that you can listen to online, they can listen to your password, they can listen to your password.
"And when I talk about these issues, a lot of people say, ""Well, it's okay, it's not a good job, but my fellow citizen, who's making a blood supply, doesn't have a lot of impact to me."
Why am I worried?
"I don't have anything to do with you."" But it's amazing."
It's a condition of privacy.
It's not okay.
It's not about the choice between security and personality.
It's the choice between liberation and control.
And by 2011, he believes in our government this year, and that's the right to do it if we destroy our rights.
But can we believe in the future, like, 50 years later, our government depends on our eyes?
And the questions like this and the questions that are going to worry about us in the next 50 years.
(Music) (Applause) Thank you for being here.
"I'm saying, ""Thank you for being there,"" because I was in the 17-year show."
And I said, well, this is the first two-thirds of the Earth's Day Day Day of Washington.
My family and friends have gathered there to listen to me.
"I said, ""I'll thank you for you for this place."" My mother said, ""Halueia, Johnny."
(Laughter) Imagine having 17 years of staying in the bush and having some kind of humming behavior.
"And my father said to me, ""That's yak"" — I'll explain that to you."
I didn't look around, because I didn't know where my voice came from.
"I didn't speak my voice in about 11 years, and I looked around, and I said, "Who is it that sounds like what I think?""
And then I realized that I couldn't make my self and laugh.
"And my father said, ""Yes, that's what I'd like to take you on this journey."
And yet, it's not the most amazing thing that we've ever been able to do.
I think it can be methane for our travels, and I want you to think about your journey.
My journey took place over 1971, when I saw two oil tankers under Golden Gate, then half a national national half national oil was in the Gulf of oil.
I was so touched by it that I decided to use drive by transportation tools.
This is a big thing for Constitution.
And this was also a big thing for the little Pinto Reyes Station I lived in Inverts, where there were 350 people living there in the winter of seventh century.
And when I went to this place, I started walking around in the pennies, people — they knew what happened.
"They asked them to say, ""What are you doing? What are you doing?"" And they said, ""I'm walking around in the pavement for the environment."" And they said, ""Well, you're okay, you're doing it to make us feel embarrassment, right?"
"You're still going to do it for you to keep us bad."" Maybe they were just so good, and I thought, ""I'm walking around in the pad, people could support me."
Because it's caused by oil that we're all suffering from.
And I was talking about it, and I was fighting people without standing with it.
I called my parents.
"And I said, ""I don't use cars."" And my father said, ""I don't know if you didn't do this when you were 16 years old?"" (Laughter) I didn't know about the environment back then."
They lived in Philadelphia.
"And I said to my mother, ""I'm so unhappy at all."" And she said, ""If you're lucky, you don't need to hear it, you don't need it, you don't need it."
So, I decided that I'm on my 27-year birthday — I've been doing a lot of controversies, and I've talked a lot about — I've decided I'm based on consulting, but one day, I'm going to go to a luxury.
So, I did this.
When I wake up in the morning, I didn't talk about one thing.
And I'm going to tell you, this was a wonderful experience for me because, for the first time, I've been listening so far.
And it made me think about what I'm equal.
Because I've always figured out that I'm always going to hear people, and I'm listening to people, and when I hear people, I don't know what they want to talk about, I don't listen to them anymore.
And when I talked about people, I thought about what I would say when I thought about them, and what I'd say when I talk about them.
And then ...
So he had the ability to communicate.
And I really heard that day.
And that's because, over these years, I knew I didn't know anything.
I was 27 years old, and I thought, well, I know everything.
But I didn't.
So I did this for the next day, and then again, and this time again, and I promised myself that I'll be in the palace for a year because I've already started learning, and I need it.
So, I didn't talk about one year, and then I thought, well, maybe I've learned some things.
However, it took 17 years to this time.
For 17 years, I walked around in the palace, and I also performed in art and banking in art and writing in my day's summer, and I tried to learn how to read books around the world.
And I thought, well, I need education.
And I went to Ashland, Oregon, and they had the learning software to see the environment around them.
It's 800 miles across.
So I went back to the office and what? What?
I showed you the email in the accident.
Oh, what do you want to read here, as you're born?
What about that?
We have a special software for you. They've done this.
And over two years, I was getting out of college.
My father came to me. He gave me a show.
"He said, ""You're my son, we're doing it with you, but we can't do it with your balcony."
"You don't drive, you shouldn't consult, you have to have them."" (Laughter) I started to take my tea and take my memory and rediscover it."
I came to Port Townins, Washington, where I made it to the trees, and I drove it through Puget Suidge during Idah to Washington and out of there, Misconsula, Monto.
Two years ago, I was approached to the University of Montana, and I liked the nose.
It wouldn't be bad for two years to stay here.
(Laughter) And that's what happened. I've been trained in college two years, and they've shown me a lot of help.
There are two stories to Montana.
The first one was that when I got there, it ran out of money.
"They said, ""Well, I'm not worried about it."" He said, ""You're going to come back to me again."" He gave me 150 dollars, and he said, ""For a lecture."
"You're going to South America, people?"" And I said to him — the tea and the lakes, the hidocrology systems, South America."
So I did this.
"He came back to me and said, ""Listen, John, I know that he's going to go from a class to a school, and you can take the office and use it as a student in a library."
And then we're able to let you go through all the professors' classes.
"And if it's easy to take a mistake and try to solve the other one, then I'm going to get a nerd, and then I'm going to get a masterpiece."" All right! They don't usually need that at the time."
It was great that they wanted to help me, and that's me.
They saw me having a lot of interest in the environment, and they tried to help me along the way.
So, in this period, I've been doing lessons without consulting.
I first had 13 students when I went into a school room.
He translates them with my hand, my friend, my friend, my friend, John Frankis, who I walk around in the pad, and I understand that he's not going to translate — that's the last lesson.
All of the demands that are around.
(Laughter) And when I didn't know the coral, I looked up and looked at them.
And I didn't think I didn't tell them.
After two weeks, everybody was trying to enter our generation.
I learned a lot in this room — and we've done these kinds of gestures.
And everybody tried to figure out what he was saying — I don't know, I think it's understanding that the trees were coming from the trees. Yes, we're going to see the trees.
No, no. That's not — it's the use of the hand.
You are somebody with hand.
You can get anyone to do it.
No, he's talking about the space of choice.
So we were talking about this, and we were discussing this.
I've come back from this work and I've gone away from it.
But what I learned was that when I showed you a picture, sometimes they played exactly the meaning that I wouldn't have thought of, but I thought I thought about it.
And I thought, if you're a teacher, if you're a teacher and you're a teacher, you don't teach yourself well.
So, I went on.
"And my father said to me in my head, and my father said, ""We're doing this with you, but you know what happened next, and he said, ""You know, you need to drive and drive."
"What do you think of doing with the Magistr certificate?"" I took my paintings, I went to the University of Wisconsin."
I've been there two years ago talking about what was going on.
Nobody was interested in oil imports.
But something happened — Exxon Parents.
And I was the only man in the U.S., writing about the oil drivers.
My father came back again.
"He said, ""My son doesn't know how they're saying it, you don't use it, you don't consult it."
"My father said, ""You need to leave your equation, because you're doing better work."" (Laughter) I've got a reputation."
I took the banjo and I threw my feet off the coast of the East Coast into the Atlantic Ocean, and it took seven years and a day to do it.
And in the 1990s, I started to say, on the 20th anniversary of the Earth's Day.
So I've been trying to look at it, because it doesn't sound like a guy who's watching it when the trees go to where they're going to land.
And I thank my family and my family because they were equally equal to me.
And that's how we communicate.
And they taught me about listening — they made me listen.
And that's something — it was listening to each other.
It really matters — we need to listen to each other.
My journey continued.
"And he blew up — he said, ""That's a yak,"" and I didn't have any hands yet."
I've been working on the Sub-Saharan Court, and I've been able to love the U.N. people.
I wrote the rules for the U.S. — the places where oil went down.
"20 years ago, if someone told me, "Jón't you want to make a difference from birth?""
""Yes, I want to make a difference.""
"They'll say, ""Well, it's starting to get into the middle of the car and start to the right place."" And a few years later, they'll say, ""Oh yeah, let's turn it off."" (Laughter) So my friend, you want to make a difference."
How does that cost? How does it happen?
How can we move around and talk about simple things as possible?
It's been beautiful in the history of science.
"And then — I worked alone here — and I said, ""Well, it's a good one to see this work."" And I took it back to Yellowsta and went back to the Gulf of Kariblia to the Gulf of Veneenuee."
The key thing was — I've got to tell you why I started to tell you.
I started to tell you, I learned about the environment around the bush.
And I've studied the environment for this very large scale, and I've studied it in the format, but it's also the level of irregularity.
And the extraordinary level — I learned about people, what we do and how we do.
And it's not just trees and birds around the environment, and it's not the species that are in danger, it's changing our relationship to each other.
And if it's around us, then we're all looking around us, and we're all looking around, and we're all looking at us, and we're going to behave with each other.
And that's what I wanted to ask you to do.
"And I said, ""I've got to go back to this year and say, 'I've got to go back to Karibib — this was my subject, and I've worked on it — I've come to Venessee and I've walked around."
This story is the end of the story, and I realized that I didn't still use cars.
I went through El Doraado — this is a prisoner, a prisoner, a prisoner — Venesue, and I don't know, because I didn't have anything to do with me.
"And as I went through the Caribbean, the monks said to me, ""Passortee, Pasaportake,"" and M11."
"And I looked at him, and I said, ""Pascort?"
I don't have to show you a passpupine, it's about my pad.
I left the U.N. Independence and Frankis and I left the world.
What did he have to say to me?
It turned out to be crazy.
They didn't laugh at me.
What do I do when I was completely free and thank God for being free?
And after I made it 150 miles, I realized that I'm pretty depressed at this point.
I was a prisoner, and I had to escape it.
It was a prisoner that I didn't use each other from transportation tools.
How can we do it?
I didn't know how to use cars when I started drawing.
But it turns out that I don't want myself to do my name every day, but I don't always want to use my legs.
I wouldn't have thought of the U.N. in my life.
I didn't think I wasn't a professor.
And so I realized that I just had other responsibility for myself, and that I had to change.
You know, we can do it without it.
I had to change it.
And I was scared of change because I'm always going to fly around — I'm always going to be connected.
Because I'm a prisoner who doesn't want the end.
I didn't know who I was going to be.
But I knew it was necessary.
I knew I needed to change, because it was the only way I could be here today.
And I know a lot of times, we're always in a place where we want to stay, but there are other places to go for us.
And we need to go to where we're now and look at our own self behind our own self and we're going to have new self.
And I'd like to try to get you guys to go to the next place — to take the prison that you see inside of yourself to where you're going to get out of prison, and it's as comfortable as I can. And today, we've got to do something on this path.
We need to change now.
And as Vitse President said in the past, we must be born.
And if my voice affects you, if my lives are affected by you, if I want to ask you to affect what I'm here.
I know that when I'm here, you can influence me all of you.
Let's go back to the world — let's take this love, this respect, this respect, to ourselves — here's TED time moving around to the world that we're showing each other.
Because our environment is environment, and our behavior, our behavior, our behavior, our behavior around us, is our behavior.
So I'd like to thank you for a little bit here, and I'd like to close my talk here for five seconds.
Thank you.
(Applause)
"Now, if you start a little bit in America, what do you do in America get to you and ask them, "Well, what's the name of this brochure?""
"And you say, ""That's the smallest part of the Oak, and that's the lower Elm."
"It's two of them, and it's 27-star."" And he says, ""Well, what's the name of this broccupy?"" You say, ""It's not the stuff."
"They've got names, and the broccccupies are just a little bit of a little bit unrelated."" Oh, a little bit of blurry and you're looking for your destination."
"Now, imagine if you're asking me if you're going to walk down in the Yaponas, and you're asking me, "You know, what's the little thing?""
"He says, ""That's 17, and that's the number 16."" And you say, ""Well what's the name of the small?"" And he says, ""Well, what's the name of the small?"" And he said, ""They don't have the names of the numbers."
They have a name of sticks.
Look at Google Maps — 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,000 pounds.
All of these broccccupies have names, and they're almost unrelated to the brochures.
"And you say, ""Well how do you define our home?"" She says, ""Well, it's easy. That's eighth Rayon."
"And if you ask the broccupy 17 and 12th of the house, ""Well, I've seen him walking around and I've seen him."" And he says, ""It doesn't take care of our house."" He says, ""Well, of course, the history that they're building is often arranged."
The first house ever built in the street is one to one.
And then the number is two of the builders.
"It doesn't happen. It's clear."" Sometimes I love it most, and we're going to go down to one of the world to see that it might be okay to understand what we never thought."
For example, doctors who are in China think that their job is to keep you robust.
In the months you don't get paid to doctors, and if you're sick, you don't pay any money, because they don't know that they're going to be able to do their work, because they're okay when you're robust, and you're getting sick.
"(Applause) So many musicians, we're trying to figure out how to start a ""ser."" One, two, three, four."
"But Western Africa has shown that music is not finished, but it's like a dot at the end of a sentence."
So, you don't just see it in parts, you see it in count. Two, three, four, one.
And that map is true.
(Laughter) I'll tell you that it's true that whatever you know about India is going to reverse it.
So, if we never forget about it, whether we're at TED or elsewhere, or if you've ever heard about it, it might be true.
Domo arigato glosehita. Thank you.
