Today I'm going to talk about unexpected discoveries.
I'm now working with solar technology.
And my little start is that we're going to get ourselves into the environment, and we're going to get it in.
And so we look at different resources.
This is just a little video about what we're doing.
Remember ... wait a minute.
It's a little bit too late.
(Laughter) We just — let's just pass that feeling — I'm going to pass through the video that's happening ... (Laughter)
No. (Laughter) (Laughter)
(Music) That's not ... (Laughter)
Okay. (Laughter)
It's solar technology.
Oh, what happened then?
Okay. Thank you very much.
(Applause)
So I want you to pay attention to what you're doing now.
And after a few minutes, I hope we'll come back to that, and I hope that if you learn to control your body a little bit, it's going to change your life significantly.
We're very interested in body language, especially attracting our attention to the language of others.
The different things get us curious: (Laughter) What we're going to talk about is irresponsible, unhappy or worrying, or even simplistic, or even hand-cuffing.
Interesting: Here they are coming home 10 numbers.
This fortunate policing is the hand of the U.S. president.
We're missing. We're putting it up.
It's all dulled.
We're trying to become invisible to the young man.
And you see, again, animals and animals do the same thing.
And when you see it in a very powerful and unpowered face, it reveals the window.
When we get started, we often tend to lose others' gestures.
And so, if someone responds to us, we try to read them, we don't reverse their gestures.
In other words, we're going to obey it.
I've seen that the MBA students are creating a lot of power jeopardy.
They're going to take themselves as a leader in the classroom, and they're going to go to the middle class, and they're not going to get to the class, they're going to be able to go to school.
When they're sitting, they're almost almost two people's place.
They're going to raise their hands in this way.
I gave myself a couple of results to myself.
The first is that it's probably not going to laugh you.
And it turns out that it's sexual.
So women are more likely to obey this blood than men are.
Women often feel more vulnerable than men, and that's not surprising.
And that's very important for the MBA students, because they're impacting their price in teaching.
We've always noticed that we're in the business schools, that we're always fighting.
The same person and the women who are ready to do, and the women, at the end of the class, are getting different prices, and it seems to be connected to the members of this.
And I started thinking to myself, and I thought, well, they're more activity in this classroom.
And if you want them to do this image, let's show themselves that they're going to be more active at teaching?
So if we show ourselves strong for a short time, can we make the difference in behavior much more powerful?
Now we know that our gestures and our magnets tend to think and feel a lot about others, and there's a lot of evidence.
But the question that really intrigues us is that these gestures and magnets have impacted ourselves.
So it's going to happen every two things.
It's also a question of consciousness.
We're going to tend to be more powerful and more powerful when we feel confident, but when you try to be powerful, we feel powerful.
And in terms of the sense of humanity, I'm going to talk about it when I think about it.
I'm also talking about physiology that forms them, and for me, these hormones, I'm learning horsmons.
What makes them think of the weaknesses?
You've seen it in the face of immortality, but 60 percent. That's as important as enough.
This is what we found in the testosterone.
Twenty-percent percent of the people who are suffering from whom they are from, and 20 percent of the people have come from their test scores, and 10 percent of them don't.
It's going to be able to change those changes in two minutes.
This is what happens in Portcuts.
Of those of you who are in the hallway, 25 percent of them have gone up to 15 percent.
For two minutes, it's allowed our brains to feel more idiotic, accurate and comfortable or stressed and so forth.
These feelings meet our raw, right?
So our body language is also about how we feel and how we feel about ourselves, not just for other people.
Our body changes the way we think about it.
The next question that we're interested in is the question that we've been asking for a few minutes to change our life significantly in terms of power.
This is a two-minute experiment that's happened in Cambodia.
So where can you apply it to the reality?
Of course, that's what makes us interested in.
We can use these poses to restore social hazards that make these posits a price for social hazards.
Where is it going to price?
So this is the archetype of food for organizations.
For some of them, they're raised in this school.
For some of them, it's an email or something like this, or a business interview.
We've probably thought that many of you have been interested in interviews, because it's the experience that you have for most of you.
"So we did a lot of our work, and the media discussed them, and the jusnists said, ""When we're in a business interview, do we do that?"
(Laughter) Of course, we denied this idea. No! We didn't do it! We didn't mean that.
The way you do it is irrational!
This is not yours.
You're interacting with yourself.
What do you do before we start the conversation?
You sit down. You look at Iphone and Android.
You look at what you're looking for, you're going to bend it, you're going to pick it up, and then you're going to have to do it, and that's what you're going to have to do. You're sitting there for two minutes.
That's what we wanted to ruin.
When businessmakers went to Turkey, they went through a business interview, where they were reintegrated and unpowered, and then they became a business interview.
She was videoed for five minutes of interviewing.
They were taught to be able to prevent the impact of the people who were able to do it, and use it in an extraordinary way to prevent it. They looked like this.
It's about five minutes more comprehensive to look at the evidence that's not analyzed.
Nobody likes it.
"And Mario LaFrance calls it ""Don't stand on your Blackbone."" This increases the level of porridge in humans."
We've taken them through an interview like this to see them.
And then we've shown four of the koders that they do.
They were unaware of our dreams, our expectations.
"They didn't know what the hell was going on, and when I looked at Video-rays, they said, ""We want to take them to work,"" and they showed them that they had a high power posit."
"We said, ""We don't want to take them to work."
"And they're more positive."" What does that impact?"
That's not because they're talking about it.
They don't agree with their speech.
Let's look at other readings. For example, how smooth are the speeches?
How many of the ideas do they have?
These showers had nothing to do.
That's not what matters.
People just showed their true sadness.
So they've created themselves.
They've shown themselves as no impressions, no impressions.
And it's affecting the fact.
"And then I tell people, when we think about our body, our behavior, our actions, can change our results, they say, ""This isn't a little stop?"" And I say."
I'm trying to make images as much as I can imagine.
"""I'm not that."
I don't want to feel like I don't want to see anyone in touch.
I don't want to be a kid.
"I don't want to be anywhere.""
"I understand these words very well, and I want to tell you a little story about the sense of ""I'm not my place,"" and it's a little bit of a story."
When I was 19, I had a very heavy car car crash.
It's gone out of cars.
I became a couple of times everywhere.
I woke up on the apparatus that could rejoice, and I had to leave the college, and the news was that I had to show you two shows from my IQ. It was very painful for me.
I was a division of IQ-Qma, because as a child, I was known as a smart and wonderful kid.
Because I was taken out of school, I wanted to go back.
"They said to me, ""You're not going to go away."
"It's not what you can do, but it's not your college."" And I'm going to start doing that, and I'm going to say, ""Well, what you've got is you've got is, you know, it's not going to make you vulnerable, like you've got your hand."
I felt completely weak.
I started, and I tried, and I worked on my own, and I succeeded.
As a result, I was finished.
"I had to spend time four years with my friends, and Susan Fiseni, my recommendation, decided to let me go to Pinston University, and I thought, ""I don't exist."" So I thought, ""I don't exist."
I was frustrated.
I've given a first study in Pinston where 20 people have heard about 20 minutes.
It was going to be the next night.
"I was so frightened that I could get my head on my head and hit my head and said, ""I can't know it."" He said to me, ""No, you're going to do it, I've come when you're in a bar."
It turns out that you're going to get around and say I'm going to do it.
And even though it's on the table.
You're going to do all the talks that you have to do.
"And again, again, you're scared, you're scared, you're scared and you're scared, and if you listen to your body, it's like, ""You've probably taken it. I've probably been able to do it."
"And I said, ""Well, you know, I'm not going to work until I'm going to say it."" So I did."
"I've been reading the high high school for five years, and I've been there for a few years, and I've been working on Harva, and I don't think about it now, but I've been thinking, ""This is not my place for a long time."" I've been thinking, ""This is not my place."
"And at the end of my first year, when I was in Harvard, I didn't talk once in the class, and I said, ""You've got to go to college, or you're going to be alive."" I've come to my students. I don't know him well."
"He said, ""It's not my place."" He said, ""It's my place.""
That turned into me.
Because two things happened.
The first thing I realized was that I didn't have that feeling anymore.
But she felt it, and that feeling was introduced to me.
And secondly, I didn't realize it was in the right place.
So it could be able to make images.
"And I said to him, ""Well, it's you."
"It's going to show itself like this in the morning, and it's going to make it so powerful."" He did it. He did it. He didn't know that it was sitting here for a few months, and it made it possible that it didn't make it feel as real as possible to make it."
It was changed.
And I'd like to tell you.
Let's image reality as much as it is.
Wow yourself as much as anyone you want to do.
I knew that I wanted to go.
They can make sure that they can make things that can make such big changes.
Now that's two minutes before I said.
Two minutes, two minutes, two minutes.
Next time you will do it, two minutes before you will, try to do it. Lift, in the living room, in the back of the desk, or at the back of the door.
And you know what you'd like to do.
Tell your intelligence to be the best way.
Give up your testosterone. You've decreased your schizophrenia.
"He said, ""Well, I didn't show them what I could do."" Don't let them stop remorse."
"You see, ""I know who I am and I show them!"" And so on."
And I'd like to leave you with the opportunity to apply these power poses to you, and I'd also like to add it to others, which is very simple.
It's not self-interest. (Laughter) You've learned this study, and you've got people who can benefit from it, and people who don't have the technology and the resources, no style and power.
And so they can do it with them, and they know that you can use it.
Just two minutes of attention to their cellularities can impact their life significantly.
Thank you.
(Applause)
And I'm sure we've got a lot of things in the world.
It's the most invisible among their superconductors.
They're like they're a fan, they're an emal material to live.
And they're working together with heavy, urgent and basic needs that benefit everyone, but they're not thanked for that.
Here in Brazil, 90 percent of the products that are going to happen again, in Brazil, are collecting them.
Most of the Katadors work independently, and they've gone down from the streets, and they've gone down to the sub-groups.
Carrocats are looking for a few smaller parts of the U.S. gasoline, or metals, and they're reminded of your own art.
That's why I didn't meet the super characters.
I'm a picture and an activist, and my colleagues are often about social, politics and environmental environmental issues.
In 2007, I was trying to support the city's life, and I was surrounded by the squares of my work.
But I've also funded foldors this time.
And it took me a lot of attention to my work, my art and my colleagues, and it helped me bring these foldors into a focus center and increase their confidence.
They're popular in the press and social media today.
I've always worked in this region since I met this world.
I've been bustling over 200 to many cities, and I've been invited to many passengers and girls around the world.
I've come to realize that they're not just coming to Brazil with invisible worlds.
I found them in Argentina, China, South Africa, Turkey, even Yaponia and the United States.
And then I realized that there should be more people involved in this, because it was a big job.
"And after that, I created a movement under ""Pimpimp Myy Carrogades."" (Laughter) It's a movement that makes money from people."
Thank you.
(Applause)
So it was a huge movement in the communities that helped make my life wonderful and shrimp, and it was a huge movement in the communities that were created.
The doctors, the starchs, the starchologists, the hair storageists, the tablegists, and the well-known professionals and health services.
Also, when the shrimp weren't built by our volunteers, they would cholish them, they wouldn't go rain, they wouldn't go well, and they wouldn't look for them.
They've taken other tools for the threat: extra subjective logos, cholera, and circuits.
And finally, they would be part of this wonderful, big passage that would be hollowing up by tiny artists.
"Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Kuribibita, amazingly."" And he went down to Sao Paulo, Rio and Rieiro."
"But what we did was we created my Pimpix, which was inspired by the city outside Brothers to meet the students' students' students' students' students' students' demands, and we created a version of them that was easy to do ""Karcrocuch."" And it's free, it's free, and it's free."
So everybody was going to join.
In about two years, 800 volunteers and 800 volunteers and 200,000 volunteers have been joined into the movement of conservation, and we've been redesigning the community, and we've been redesigning it in the local schools.
And now, as they look back in the invisible invisible, there would be people that are respectful and worthy of what's worthwhile.
They know that you're going to come up with ideas that are fascinating because of their profits, their revenues and their relationships in the community.
And now I'm going to invite you to see the folders in your city, and the other invisible superheroes, and to recognize them.
Working to see the Earth as a whole without borders and borders.
It doesn't want it to land, it doesn't have more than 20 million times in the world.
When you see someone coming to him, you know them as part of our life.
Muito origami, thank you.
(Applause)
In the '5000s, the Noyal Forest called Al-Saharan Mankira, was composed to the team of Al-Saharan people in Manhattan, and Mirie Kahan, who was the leader of the Muhammad in the Yuis.
It's been known to be guilty of this, but when it's discovered that there's a light-fashioned device, it's done in common with other people in New York City, where they're in a row of albies: tunnels, digests, nests and U.N.s are planning for cells.
Luckily, the planes were brought down by the FTB partners.
But sadly, in 1994, the World Ticujan bombard couldn't be able to do it.
And then, in the last century, Nikira has been a quarter of a century, and it's a sub-Saharan population.
Al-Saharan Nhranda is my father.
In 1983, I saw him in Pennsylvania, Pittsburg, and his great-grandfather, and his great-grandparents, and his name, and I became able to see the world as being a teenager, and I was able to figure out what he was doing to my hand for a living.
From my age, my family began to change my relationship to my family.
My father inspired me to see the sides of Islam, many Muslims, many people, many Muslims, many of whom I see.
And I've learned these things from my life, and after I know each other enough, people don't really have a long time to understand that each of us has the same expectations of life.
In every single religion, there may be few people in every milliseconds that have the impact of faith in every single milliseconds and other people who feel the power to drive for their own lives.
A couple of months ago, my father had told me that in the last couple of weeks, he had come up with my friends in London, and he understood that they had a training team of jewelonism in London.
And he said I'm not going to go with him in the morning.
We were in Kalverton Atlong, and then we didn't know that there was a FTB-E observer.
My father had helped me hold up at my age, and he tried to figure out how to target 30 meters.
And then the last smile I jumped on was a little bit of orange on the screen, and it was a little bit of a blueprint that everybody was surprised, especially me.
"And I'm saying, ""I'm an albah,"" and I'm going to go back to the other men and say, ""I'm an in Arabic."" And he said, ""You know, they're all done."
Well, it all laughed, but after a few years, I realized what they were laughing.
And they thought that my father could do it, and that I could see it.
And in the last case, these people were known as the furgon of the Earth's Ticulon, which was full of about 700 pounds of compulsion, and they were known to make sure that they were killed by six people, and they were killed in the 1990s, and they were able to help many people.
These are people that I'm taking my self.
"Don't you say it"" — it was the people I called."
And as I was 19 years old, we changed our place to live for 20 years, and during my childhood, my friends had become less and less of my friends.
It would be that I felt like I was walking around with my own self, and it would be moving away from me.
As a new person in the classroom, I always became the goal of the child, as a new person.
I kept my self being in the middle of a school, but it turned out that my class was the most simple and aggregate of the classroom.
So I spent a lot of my time reading books at home, watching books and playing books.
So there was a conflict in the ability of social communication, and I didn't have the realization of life as a growing person in the class.
I grew up in a environment where people are not rational, such as race and religion.
So what happened to my eyes?
And one of my first experiments to try to figure out how I think about this kind of way was the election of 2000.
I've been able to participate in the University of college in the National Guard Foundation in Filadel University.
And the group that I had in my community has been interested in the violence of young people, and I didn't worry about them as one of the things that I had in my life, as well as one of the people who had a kid who was a kid who was a kid who was a kid who was a kid.
The scientists of our group were people who had different lifespan.
I've learned that one of the children I've been friends with in the last few days in the world are Jewish.
I realized that this was found only a few days, but I realized that there was no way that we could be able to transfer the enemy from both of us.
I felt like I had a Jewish friend before, and I felt that I was proud of myself who believed that my life was never before, that my life had never been given me.
And it turned out to be more important, and I found a job in the Y's Buches Garden fungens.
I'm here on the project of people who have different faith and civilization, and this experience has played the fundamental role of building a human being.
I've been taught that my life is guilty of homosexuality, and I've learned that all gay impacts have similar effects in Afghanistan.
It worked so that in one of the audience, I was able to try to work with gay artists, and by the way, they were the people that I've ever seen as a lot of people who are the most fruit people that I've ever tried to do.
I found out that I felt like someone who was too late to try to help other people feel like they were, and it made me feel a sense that I didn't want to move around and take care of my self to other people that I didn't want to do.
Because of my experience, as a child, I could actually compare students to literally my life experience.
I don't know what it feels like to be aunt, but I can't meet you very well with what it's like to do with reasons that it doesn't work on you.
"And then there was ""The Daily Sow."" And And Stuart inspired me to become honest with my own self-interest, and to help me realize that the human race, race, religious sexuality and sexualism, was not about the rights of religion."
The Ed Stuart, the moment I needed a ancestor, it literally ran away to me.
My inspiration didn't come out of the place where I had a lot of expectations of Jewish and Jewish people came out of my view of the world, because my father was more positive than my father.
One day, I had a conversation with my mother about the change of my world, and my mother told me that I would not be able to pull my life out of my heart.
"My mother looked at me through his eyes as a man who lived enough tomatoes throughout his life, and said, ""I'm afraid to hate people."
I understood how negative energy it requires you to hate them in a moment.
My Zak Ebrah is not my real step.
When I decided to start my wife's relationship with my family and my father, I changed my life.
Why did I have no idea why did I have a whistleblower?
The answer is quite simple.
And I hope that maybe there's a tendency to hear a story about it, and maybe there's a lot of it that's in the right way, and it turns out that there's a story that's going to be a little bit better, and I haven't been able to conquer ideology.
Instead, I chose to use my life as a fight against my terrorism and the fight against my feminism.
This is what the victims and their aspirations, the horrific pain and pushes that happen to them.
I'm going to save my father's movements in this sort of accidental activity, and I'm going to stop him from losing the victims of terrorism.
Like the simple example of what I'm talking about, I'm a living creature, where my son is going to pass my tea and my race, and I don't have to go through the road.
I'm not like my father.
Thank you very much. (Applause) Thank you very much. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)
No morning!
Are we inconvenient?
They took a step-by-step version of it, but I wanted to ask you to ask, what's someone here in Arabic called the name of the subject?
Anybody's? Who? Well, no problem.
And a while ago, I sat down with my friend in the regime, and I sat down with food.
"I looked at him, and I said, "What are you doing?"" (Laughter)
He looked weird to me by thinking that word was equal to mistakes.
"And he said, ""Come on? (Laughter) And I said, ""Listen, if he can't laugh."" And he said, ""You know, what does he say to him?"" "I know.""
"He said, ""No! It's called him ""Amen,"" or ""massively"" — what's wrong?"
"He said, ""Well, don't come to do that!"" He said."
"He was excited to talk to me, and he said to me, ""It's so apologizing that if there were the last girl in the world, I couldn't look up on her!"
"What does it mean to say ""Menu"" in Arabic?"
In two words, Livian young boy, she's back in her life, and she's got a reason for her.
How could we talk about this?
And then I started thinking.
It made me angry.
That's a guy's really trying to fix it!
They're not because I'm speaking to you in my own country.
Where else can this happen?
How do we get there?
But there's a lot of people here, like me, that they can go through a moment in their own life so far that they simply pull it out as an extraordinary one of the things that happened in order to know that they're only modern and cultural.
What if I had to forget my entire civilization, my ideas and my lives?
We could have had the lives of childhood that we had about experience.
Everything I learned in Arabic is just to adapt everything that I learned in Arabic.
Should I forget to be one of them?
What did I do here?
Although all of this, I tried to understand him.
I didn't want to make sure that he didn't make sense of me.
The Arabic language doesn't respond to the students of this day.
It's not the language of science, it's not science, it's not the language of science, it's not the language that we've been accustomed in the work that we're used in college, and it's not the language that we've used in the air port.
If we were to think about it, they would say we're wearing clothes.
And why would I use my language? We all need to ask these questions!
You don't want to use Arabic. Can we use it?
It's a reality.
But there's another reality that we have to think about.
The Arabic language is the native language.
In search, it's said that in other languages, you have to be perfect in the main language to know that it's great.
It's an amazing language that allows us to express ideas in other languages in a creative way.
How?
When Cibran Xicill started writing for the first time, he used the Arabic language.
His whole ideas, his dreams, and his personality, became the source of the little boy in the village, who grew up in a special voice.
So when he started writing in English, he had enough base.
Even that, when you're reading the script in English, you're feeling the love of it, you're having that feeling.
You can imagine that he wrote in English, this son from the Livan mountains.
That's one example of who's not going to argue.
Secondly, the counter-esthesia is that if you want to kill a mile, the only way you don't kill a mile is to kill it.
It's a reality that has developed societies.
The Germans, the French, the structure, the pins — are aware of these nationalities.
And so they don't make sure that they can protect their own language.
They make it sacred.
So they use language, they pay a lot of money to develop language.
Can we know more than them?
Well, we don't have developed the world, we don't have yet come to us, and we want to build with the cultural world.
And once we've been doing research for development, but they've been doing research for us in those countries, and they've been moving over to Turkey, Mayzia, and so on and so forth as countries go to the top of the country, and they've protected it as if it's not taking it.
They've taken them close to language.
Because if you're going to take a product out of Turkey or somewhere, and you don't have a tag on it, it's not a local product.
You didn't believe it was a local product.
They'd be the receiver before. They'd be the qualities that we're most of the time.
So they had to protect their own language to innovate and produce.
"So what will happen to you in English, in fact, is, ""Honness, water, independent""?"
What doesn't mean, it's straight?
Who, who, and why, yet.
It's not just a way that language comes from a network, it's not a way to talk about each other.
The language is what we're looking at, and what we're trying to call the thermostatology of our life, which is based on our emails.
"So when we go to the ocean, we say, ""Holyness, water, independence,"" each of you has special images being alive in their personal history, in their private history, they have special feelings in a particular day."
It's not a language connecting between two words and three letters.
It's the idea that we're going to understand how we think about each other, how we see each other, how we see each other.
What is the objective?
How can you say, lowering the human face, no?
"So if I'm going to, in fact, say, ""Holyness, waterfall,"" and if you're going to come to your son, or if you're going to say, "Dad, you're your son, you're your liberation?""
What does it feel?
If you don't see the problem, I would be like, well, I would come out and I wouldn't talk empty.
That's what it means to remind us of something special.
I have an unhappy friend of mine.
I asked him one day, how do things go?
"He said, ""Everything's good. But one day I've tried to translate the word ""trintoghborne,"" (Laughter) (Applause) And the women who's wrong, and then all the words have tried to explain it."
"And she said, ""What can you do?"" And she said, ""Well, you know, how can you be so accidental?"
Who wants to steal?
"It's like, ""Who's me?"" (In Arabic) This is one of a few examples."
We started thinking like this, because we couldn't deal with it, women can't say that word to it, and they're okay to deal with it. It's different about it.
"And my friend said to me, ""Oh, listen to me and I tried to translate him for a night, and I tried to translate him to him, and when I listened to Firuz, you felt that I felt what I was saying for him."" He tried to translate it to him: "I got my hand out of them and I moved you out of it. (Laughter) And that's the problem: "You know, I'm going to leave you and I'm leaving you."" (Laughter)"
So translation this to me.
(Applause) What did we do to protect Arabic?
We've turned it into the issue of citizenship, and we've started campaigning to protect Arabic.
"And so many people told me, ""Why would you worry?"
"It's fun for you to forget and for yourself."" There's no problem!"
"And that was the case of a campaign to protect my husband: "I'm talking to you from the east, and you're going to answer me from the Western.""
"We said, ""No! We don't think about it, we don't think about it."" We didn't choose it because they didn't cope us in this way."
And if someone tells me how he's talking about it, I hate to speak to Arabic.
We say, (Applause) We want to change our reality and change our dreams, our aspirations and our everyday lives.
We're going to channel people like us to think about clothes and things like us.
"It's like, ""I'm talking to you right now, but you're going to respond to me from the West."" It was like, ""You know, I'm talking to you."
Very simple, also creative and creative.
And then we started to campaign something else that we could call the land.
"You saw this example on the scene of a black and yellow strip, which says, ""Don't kill your skin on the scene."
Why? In fact, don't kill malaria.
We also need to kill our language.
If we had to kill our language, we would be able to tap our self.
We would be able to tap ourselves.
We'd have to go back.
It's also a serious issue than losing our chance to be modern and cultural.
And after that, we've taken pictures of the white men and girls who we've texted Arabic.
"""Cool"" are pictures of girls and boys."
We have a lot of ""cool""!
"And who said, ""Oh, you used the English word!"" I said, ""Oh, I'll run the word 'colo! I'll make the word 'cause I'm in my way."" Well, no matter how denial they are, but let me say a more beautiful promise, which is to me."
"I'm going to go on and say, ""The Internet."" And I say, ""I'm going to go to my world's trap."" (Laughter) Because that's not a creature! We shouldn't take ourselves."
But as we come to this point, we have to believe that if it's a language, we don't let people think it's bigger and we don't allow them to think it's bigger, we're going to be able to control us, we're trying to think that they're asking us, or they're asking us what they're asking us.
It's an idea of creation.
If we can't fly into the universe, or we can't make rock. We can be creative.
So now, all of you have been doing a creative project.
It's a way of creativity in your native language.
So let's start with this.
Let's write a novel and take a short film.
If the romance can rediscover us.
This can lead to Arabic again.
"No way to say, ""There's no way to talk."" There's no way to talk!"
But we need to know and believe that there is a way to talk, and it's part of the way that we talk about it.
As individuals, what can you do today?
The gravitations, who's making gravitations?
If I'm running out of time, I'm going to ask you to do so much in Arabic, in English, in French, or in tea.
But don't write in Arabic with numbers of Latin Latino graphs.
(Applause) This is disaster! This is not language!
You become infected with viral language to the world.
It's not easy to get back and forth.
That's not the first thing we can do.
Second, there are many other things that we can do.
We're not gathered here today to make a sense of a faith.
We're here to take care of the importance of this language that we're able to protect.
Now I'm going to tell you a mystery.
She knows for the first time through her horses.
"And when my daughter was born, I was going to say to her, ""That's what you are."" I said to him in English, ""Go what you are."" And I said to her, ""Great, hon."" And my girl, Nura, I'm talking to her, and she said, ""You know, I'm talking to the Arabic, and I'm telling her, I'm saying, ""Man, I'm not going to say it, and I'm not going to do it."
(Applause) Let's build ourselves through this cultural configuration. (Applause)
I learned a few things when I was experimenting these 30 days.
And I took a picture every day for a little bit.
30 days before I started experimenting.
It's bad.
In fact, they're very fun.
(Applause)
I had a great reader, and my expectations were high, and I started a student of students with a sense of love, a lot of advice, a lot of food, and a lot of the way I started to learn.
And yet, I felt so catastrophic, self-worthy, trustworthy, and I was scared of the space that I had in my future, that I had felt a failure and a failure.
"And as I was headed, as I was before, when I left the room and left the room, I would have heard a horrific voice: ""Oh, she's leaving the room."" And I've been walking around."
I had no one in my side-by-one. I had no idea what was the light and preciseness of the foundations I had.
"""He's going to open your door."" I'm equal."
It was a start. It turned off.
And just days ago, after weeks, my brother spoke to me at a fraction of the people in 2004.
"They're like, ""Let's go.""
And so, for a while, my friend and even a few years, he was quiet and hopeful, but I also thought, well, this sounds like a voice that I didn't give up when I went to a visit.
For example, when I'm still still alive, I'm often suspicious of my anger and real emotions.
So I came up with the eruptions behind the logging: normal people don't equal sounds, and my equality was a serious positment.
I didn't know if I took a Ph.D. student.
I thought, well, I needed this curiosity and I needed help, and I started to talk to him about my neighborhood.
"So for example, I was a student's team of campaigns, and I wanted to go to college and say, ""I want to speak to my students at night, I want to go to college."
And then it started to get out of my fast control.
I've been stuck with cafeteria, looking for you, and then the most part: my self and my future, a desperate hopefulness, a desperation that's connected to my brother and my brother.
My voice, not the simple life experience of my voice, but because I'm convinced that it's literally symbolized, it's become empowered, and it's become empowered.
It was a kind of a psychological battle in my mind, a kind of psychologist, and as a result, the sounds started to rise, and the enemy started to speak angry and angry.
Can you see the water in it?
And as a result, I've gone through the paths of fear, of ignorance, of ignorance, of faith, of understanding, that I've been unable to create peace and peace in this fight that I've felt without power.
Two years later, my situation got bad.
I'm here with all the girls: the horrific sounds, the images of the sounds, the strange, unthinkable.
Now, when you look at the wider and hopelessness of those years, I think one person is dying, and another person is saving.
It's led to a journey of people who have been isolated and drowned, and they're going to get out of that journey, and they're going to be able to go back to a person who I'm going to be growing up.
A lot of people in my lifetime hit me, and I remember all of them, but it was very weak and left compared to people who helped me.
Well, Eleanor is going to do this.
"And sometimes when it rains on the table, it's absolute."" At 14 minutes, he told me, ""Well, I'm not allowed to thank all these wonderful people who were going to fight me and fight me, and I'm going to thank you all these wonderful people coming back from the outside of the equations and suffering."
Of course, it was hard to believe that sounds like no, no, no, no, no, no matter whatsoever, I couldn't really understand what I was doing before we first got to the truth.
So for example, I've learned the sounds that they're not going to touch my house — but the objects that I feel are not like danger, and the feelings of danger that I feel.
I believed them on a daily basis.
I remember even one night sitting in the door of my parents, taking pictures of my parents' voices to protect them from what I thought was real.
"You don't know."
"You know, I've got a mismatch?"" That's Stratchi."
And after that, I realized that what happened was that I grew up in the middle of my life, and I was able to get rid of the drugs that were coming from the people who were teaching, and then I went back to the psychiatrists of all the other roles.
Right now — I'm very proud of the Intervoicoic — I've heard about the fact that the Interval Journalists now feel an organization, and I've come from Professoria and Dr. San Francisco Echerer's work, and it's an attempt to think about sounds like life's worthy of life, the theory of life, the theory of life, but it's not a problem, and it's as if it's a problematic and it's the way that it's worth working.
It's not able to do this kind of community, it's already being built.
Now, there's a similar phenomenon that social change doesn't have to go back if social changes start.
She doesn't want to say she's dead.
It's not going to pressure people who are not afraid.
In the last 20 years, the Supreme Court has spread across 5 continents and 26 countries, and a few siblings expand the possibility of the people who have great challenges of humankind and souls, and we're going to deliver hope and prophecies, and we're going to be able to reach the full potential of our civilization.
And as Pitter Levin said, it's an unintentional thing that has access to this ability to use human health in order to use it.
In this case, the greatest honor for our community — is to help someone who needs to provide health, to be with, to reach out, to share his hands, to connect and to the health of our community.
We're unique. We're unthinkable.
You don't have to take what happens in our skin and do it for us.
It doesn't turn off.
"As my grandfather once told me, ""Some people don't know what you're doing when you're in a bar."
"Don't talk about your attention."" Thank you very much."
(Applause)
I'm here to talk about my photography.
But is this photograph?
Because, of course, it's not a picture that we can draw with our camera.
But yet, my love of photography began when I first photographed my first 15-year-old photograph.
I've been fascinated by the artist before, but in a slightly different way, because when I was using a camera, I've planned the process out of a sort of first.
When you draw a picture with photosyncho, it's ready to do it when it hits a button.
And for me, it wasn't just happening in the right time in our pictures.
I thought, well, anybody could do that.
So I wanted to create something different, something that my picture started to evolve later.
So pictures like this: this is the construction that works on a road.
But it's an unexpected game.
And yet, it seems closer to reality.
Or pictures like this — both dark colors and colors, but they're all able to protect a certain amount of reality.
When I say Realism, I mean picture-making.
Because, of course, I don't want the pictures that we can really see, but I don't want to have the pictures that are going to be seen as a camera.
I don't want to be able to think a little bit about it.
So it's really about trying to make sense more accurate than actually catching the moment.
But what about it that makes it look real?
Is it relevant to color or color?
Is it related to light?
What makes the difference?
Sometimes it's a perspective that makes the difference.
But in the end, how do you deal with the world, how do you do that in two dimensions?
It's not really what this reality is, it's really what it looks like to us.
So the basic idea is very simple.
I see this happening in a real world where I'm creating a reality, an alternativ reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
There are three numbers here that are perfectly imaginable physical objects, three-dimensional things that are relevant to our world.
But it turns out, in a certain way, it looks like three-dimensional objects that exist again.
But we also know that it can't exist.
So we play your brain because our brains don't know that the meaning of reality is not.
And when I combine the same process with pictures, I see them.
It's actually about reconnecting different facts.
So a picture of what really matters, I think, is things that we don't think about, in our everyday lives, are things that are around us.
And as the images combine them, it's really important to see, because otherwise, it seems wrong.
What I'd like to say is that there are three simple rules that we have to follow in order to get a real deal.
As you can see, these images don't have a special aspect.
But you put it together, and you get something like this.
So the first rule should be the same from the perspective of images together.
Second, images that are united should be the same as light.
And in both ways, I've looked at these two conditions — they're high, and they're taken in the same light.
But for a while, it makes a simulation, and it's about making it impossible to make a picture of where someone started from.
You're going to be able to put together in a way that you can't be able to do it.
In the intersections between different images, the colors and the contractions of the original, the deep inside of the box, the pale colors and the xenixes, and the boundaries between different pictures, and yet we can make it look like a single picture, even though there are hundreds of details.
Here's another example.
(Laughter) People might think it's an image of a field, and it's a sub-confidence that has changed.
But it's actually a completely different picture that we've gone from pictures of different places.
I think it's easier to create a place, to find a place, to change your ideas in this way, even though it's less.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And I knew that I had a couple of months to plan and figure out the parts of template and tapestry that would integrate the parts of the rock.
For example, I took a picture of a bar when I held a honeybe.
And they're looking at different things.
I could have taken a stone of six percent of the water.
And yes, I've been able to break red to see the house at the peak of the room where it looks like Sweden.
So it's possible to get an answer close to reality, I think it's possible for planning.
Every time it starts with a black, an idea.
And then we've come up with different pictures.
So it's like, each piece has been planned very well.
And if you take pictures good, the results can be quite beautiful and distinctly realistic.
So we have all the possibilities that we need, and the only thing that makes us limited is our imagination.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Chris Anderson: Thank you, thank you.
It was given a data like this that Wikieaks, you know, we've published more data in the years than all the world media broadcasts.
Can we do that?
JA: Yes, can that be true?
The rest of the world is a worrying about how bad it works, right? A small group of activists could spread more information than all the press around the world.
CA: How do you do that?
How does people spread these documentations?
How is it preserved the principle of love?
JA: And as much as we know, these are the ones that we've got information, and there are different ways for these data to keep us up.
We're trying to address the country's prosecutions like Sweden and Bellikika to prevent it from getting it comfortable on the Internet, encrypting it, providing the law preserved.
It turns out that it's encrypted or simplistic, it's making format — it's a little difficult in the middle of these giant data-based networks — it's a little difficult — it's open to the public, and it's safe for our political cells, and it's self-defined to our political cells.
CA: So the documentation of documents is essential. You don't know who the sources of information are.
JA: That's right. We rarely know them, and if we ignore the data, then we destroy it.
(Tlephone call) Thank you.
(Laughter) CA: I think CIA-dad, asked a TED-a-half-year-old chance. (Laughter)
Let me take a look at what we're looking at.
This is the data that's been set up a few years ago.
Let's look at you.
It was a story from Kenya.
How do you talk about this story?
JA: This document Krold Report.
In 2004, after the election, there was a study done by the Kenyan government.
In 2004, they moved by Daniel Mii, in 18 years to election, and run by Daniel Mi.
He was a dictator in Kenya.
When they came up with the power of Caltech and the Kibabi challenge, they published two million pauses to spend it together.
The government used this figure at that time in Kenya at the time and now the richest man, like the political power of the government.
It's like a holy book of a Kenyan journalist.
In 2007, I just went to Kenya and I knew about the election of 2007, that I could go and collect documentaries.
And we started to get this figure close to the money of the new president Kibabi Daniel, and we published three days after we started to get into the money of Mino, and after that, the Princip of Kibabuli was in charge.
CA: So it's almost a little bit like Kenya's press, but it's not directly to the Kenya press. And you think that's the result of the election.
JA: Yeah. Yes. The news was on the front page of the Guardian, and then somewhere around Kenyania and Canubi in Africa.
It came out of the news.
Within a few days, Kenya press began to relax to the issue.
Twenty days later, he published in the Kenya press, and he changed about 10 percent of the sounds of the Kenyan security services, and led to the following results.
CA: So what really changed the world?
JA: Yes.
(Applause) CA: And this time, there's a video about the air cell in Baghdad.
Video itself is a little longer. It's a short nectar shape.
First of all, I'm going to tell you, there's a little bit of a syringe in this video.
Radio: ... waste waste, it just pops up.
Now they look, they look at the Xammer.
We can see it. It's cool.
If we see everybody, it's okay.
Hold everybody up.
It's cool, huh!
Stay up with a gun. (Cheeping) Okay. (Cheeping)
Otel ... This is the Buddhma Two-Six, Buhmaster Two-Six.
We needed to go back, now!
We killed eight people.
There are two taxatolyots, and we're going to go wild.
They did. They all died.
Two-Six, Two-Six-Six-ray talk, moving.
Oops. Don't forgive me. What was he?
Kyle, Kle. Oh, he's got a solution, haha.
CA: What did this video have impacted?
JA: It's heavy for people who have this stuff.
It was sent to two people in Baghdad to study this video.
This is actually one of three cells in the video.
CA: If I don't know you've seen it, 11 people have died on this cell with two partners?
JA: Yeah. Two computers have died, two children have been helped.
In amazingness, 186 men died.
CA: The publishing of these things caused a huge amount of damage.
Why was it because of the accident and the tragedy?
JA: I don't know, I don't know, I think people have seen the impossible nature of power.
The Apachian taxyotu people who are comfortable with the family are laughing at their 30-mmmegs, without any reason — and even killing the people who are rescuing tomorrow.
There were two journalists who weren't making sure that they weren't a maker, and they're doing their work.
CA: The security of the U.S. security was approached by Bradley Mann, and it turns out that with video in the survey, Mr. Teszler has declared to tell you that the progress of the United States has been written.
Is that true?
JA: We made these scripts denial.
Five days ago, it's been jailed after 150,000 writings before it had it.
This year, we've been publishing the documentaries of Reykiavikvy on the U.S. expedition, but they don't have a relationship to it.
I became involved in that journey.
CA: What if you could take the U.S. journey to the submatomic documentation?
JA: We're publishing them. (CA: Can we publish them?) JA: Yeah. (Applause) JA: What's it? (Applause) JA: So in the literature like this, in the country's literature, we've found that in fact how the reality is, we've found the rights poses in the countries in the Arab world.
If you open up certain documentaries, you have these kinds of materials.
CA: Let's talk a little bit about this in detail.
In science, what are you based on ideology?
What do you do when you publish specific documents in general?
JA: So there's a question about, which information is important for the world, and what information can lead to redesigning.
There's a lot of work going on.
It's the kind of casualties of the world that they're trying to hide, and what's good for them, and the institutions that have these information, they know how to hide information, and they know how to hide.
That's what it's like. It's the history of Journalists.
CA: But it's not dangerous, it's not dangerous, it can affect you, it can even be bad for the whole community.
JA: But it hasn't happened in the data that we've spread.
So we have policies to be preserved from harm.
There's some personal information that allows those people to communicate with themselves and then publish them.
And there's also the laws that are mysterious — like, I've been involved with my scientists, and I've been doing this kind of code, but we've been working with newssters that really do what they do.
CA: That's all good stuff.
"And one of the guys who gave birth to the United States came up to you and said, ""You know, you want to spread the purpose that you want?"" This is a video."
The U.S. military people are laughing when they're laughing.
It shows millions of people around the world that they don't feel human. It's not.
"That's not my son. What would you be courageous?"" What would you answer?"
JA: Well, there's a lot of these things.
But keep in mind that there is no need to see this video of the people in Afghanistan, Iraq, Afghanistan, and they see it every day.
It doesn't change their minds. It doesn't change their dignity, it doesn't change their feelings.
They see it every day and wildness.
That will change the relationship of people who are paying for wars, but that's what we're willing to do.
CA: So you're a way to light the secret sets of companies and companies.
It's good to see.
But what's weird is that you have to keep the sources of self hidden to light the firts.
JA: Not exactly. But those of you who didn't get to WikiLeaks.
Or we don't have information that's similar to the sources that we're talking about.
If they're like this, and they're breeding, it might be hard for us. We're working so that men who are working on us are trying to help us keep doing things that are going on.
CA: And I've been interested in what they've been saying about it, and what do they think about it?
There are two kinds of ideas about WikiLeaks and Jacan.
One is — I'm glad to make sure that there's needs.
The second one is dangerous bee.
Who thought that was awesome?
What about dangerous beekeeping?
JA: Well, there should be a couple of men who would have never been.
CA: So, this was the kind of stuff that I had, Jacan.
Let's try a little bit more. Let's show you another example.
I don't think it's been published yet this time, but it's going to be published at TED.
What's interesting about this recently?
What is this document?
JA: This is an example of what we see every day.
Last year, last year — Noyo Baken, Albana, the Gulf of Mexico, but not as strong as the Gulf of Mexico.
We came up with an engineering figure like this, and I actually spent a lot of time with the way that a large number of companies collision the loads of cars that are located.
The U.K. government and others have been here.
But there was no relationship with them, and there was a little difficult document.
We didn't know who was writing and what was going on.
We'd probably thought it would be the vote of the oil company.
"So we looked at the document, and we said, ""We're less likely to be."
We can't know how to do it.
"It's a good document. We can't see it, but we can't see it anyway."" If we asked this one to see the sources of data, and this is from a company that's writing a text — (Laughter) — he said, ""We want to get the data out."" And we said, ""Well, let's do some data."
What documentism do you talk about?
Doesn't you belong to you as a source of law?
"What are you really?"" And they answered the screen, and they sent me a picture of the documentary of the Mozo Word ID series."
That's how we built it.
(Applause) There's a lot of this.
One of the ways that the prisoners of the source of knowledge is one of the methods that he wrote to letter.
CA: So, do you have BP-E data?
JA: Yes, but also — now we're working on a mantra for counting, and the engineers are doing their hand.
We've gone down to a news class of people that we've been trying to redesign the core of our public interest in the last few months to try to redesign our interests.
This is a little problem.
In other ways, as we're starting to do with new activity, we're going to have a whole range of challenges, and we don't have enough workers to store all this data, even though it has so much information.
CA: So what's the point to you is that there's a lot of charity and charity that we're going to need to be able to employ employed by the peer-to-peer journalists and peer-peer journalists?
JA: Yes. People we believe.
The data that we have in our hands is hard to develop in a slightly different way, and then we're looking at higher levels of security, and there's people to be able to deal with security issues.
CA: So can you say why didn't it start working?
I don't know if I said, well, 37 schools have changed in childhood.
Is it true?
JA: My parents were a business of films, and my religious ceremony was the result of two.
(Laughter) CA: Now, scientists, this is what we think of as parania.
JA: What do you think of creation?
(Laughter) (Applause) CA: I don't know that you're in the young age, and you're in the hands of the painting.
JA: I was a Journalist.
I was one of the young scientists in the office.
I was arrested because of the work that I was doing in young people.
We need to treat Xakers a little bit of money.
You can do different things with the Xarker path.
Unfortunately, most of our X-rays have been able to bring money to the Russ's grandmother's grandmother's money in the bank.
It's not like the Xarker seller before.
CA: I don't think you've done it, and you've spent your grandmother trying to steal your grandmother's money. What are the important values?
What if you can give you a little bit of information about them, or can you talk about things that make them happen?
JA: I think that's what it means.
But my point is: I think there are people who can't create skills and products; they help victims.
That's what I learned from people like my father, my father, my father, my dad.
CA: It doesn't create a Baccar, it doesn't create a human being; it's a gorilla?
JA: I don't think I can just show them that they can be a gorilla, but in a dose — I mean, I'm a carrier, because we can imagine people who are suffering from homicide.
This is my character that I've known for a long time.
CA: Can you just talk about what happened in Iceland in the last few minutes?
And there's the problem that you're publishing, and there's the reason why you're trying to make news, and it's prosecuting the network of news.
Instead, it's popular.
You created a good amygmist in Iceland, and what happened?
JA: That was the big issue.
It was economic in Iceland.
It was one of the biggest people in the world.
It was 10 times more than any other product in my bank sector.
We published this information last year in the Iyul.
"It's been prosecuted to Congress about 5th before, as in the movie, from the news of prosecutions, five years ago, and it started before, and it didn't work, "It didn't happen. What would we have to have?""
We were broadcasting the news, and we were quite famous in Iceland, and we even went there and talked about the issue.
Everybody in the community was able to make sure that we're not going to do this again, but as a few of the members of Spain and politicians, after interviewing international pharmacy and international scientists, there's going to be a new project that's going to be the gorors of the government in Iceland, and one of the most fundamental laws in this world that we've been able to protect journalists in this world, because of the law of compassion, the Nelsobo.
In Iceland, Norse, he knew that there was another scanning country going into the system.
And one month ago, this law was hidden in the Israeli parliament.
CA: Wououu.
(Applause) My last question is Jenna.
What do you believe in the future? Do you think that the Great Brothers will be able to control everything in secret, or will people watch the Large Brothers surveillance, or other kinds of things?
JA: I'm not sure how it could be.
All over the world — all over the world, China and the U.S., all over the world, there's a lot of freedom and legislation going up.
It's hard to see what the future will be.
It's a very interesting period of time that we're living, and we're able to change everything through a lot of effort.
CA: Well, I don't know what it means to your people, to your children, to yourselves, to yourselves, to yourselves.
JA: Thank you very much, Chris. (CA: Thanks.) (Applause)
I am a writer. I'm a writer.
I'm trying to tell you a story and write a novel, and I'm going to talk to you a little bit about what you're trying to do today, and I'm going to give you a little bit about what's called a species-like creatures.
But let me tell you a little bit about my personal story before we get to these things.
I'm going to use words, and it's a geometry, and you're going to see a couple of circles when they're watching my head.
In Strapsburg, Francesa is born in Turk.
After that, my parents are empty, and I've come to Turkish, and I've come to my mom and I've come to Turkey.
I've been adopted by being the only child at the time that we can't have the moment.
In the 1970s, it was a little strange.
Most of our families in our village were the grandparents of a family, and I grew up with my mother, who was the only divorce woman in the Patriarxal environment.
Actually, I grew up with two groups of women.
On one hand, she was a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, who was modern, hunted, T.C. — she was a woman.
On the other hand, I always had the rest of my care, the religious, the less spiritual, the less tolerant, the less naive grandmothers.
My brother, who's looking at it, and he's going to look at it, and he's able to build the devil's eye, and he's going to get it to a variety of different species.
They're deep in their hands, and people who are wasteed in their hands are going to visit the grandmother.
Every time my grandmother, my grandmother, they would have put up more gold cycles than they had to buy red in Arabic.
And then, once again, a builder, it's much more compounding.
A week later, the patient had a voice for the patient.
I know that it may sound so bizarre to talk about these things as a young man, but I don't know that people who came across the village to talk about it in different kinds of jewelry jewelry jewelry jewelry jewelry and left.
"I said, ""What do I say from my grandmother?"" That was the power of the stunt?"
"He said, ""Well, of course, prayers have the power, but the power of the fundamental circles."" And what I learned from that is that I learned a lot of important lessons, and if you want to do nothing in life, whether you want to do it, or whether you want to do it, or whether it's a person's or a person's soul or a soul or a wall, it's going to be able to turn it into a thick wall."
It's going to be built inside.
All of us now are from inside of social and cultural circles.
We're all in it.
We're all born to a certain family, a ring, a synchrony.
But when we don't know what we belong to, we're confronted with the risk of interconnectedness when we're distant.
We're less likely to be able to do our imagination, and I'm sure that when we're in the environment we're still so long, we've lost a sense of human beings.
I'm also saying that our friends, our friends, our partners, our partners, our family, our families, and we're very similar, and we're pretty much more comfortable with our own self-interest.
The women, like my grandmother, are doing something like this, and they're wrapping up the surface of the day with a piece of rice, or they're spinning the face across the south.
It's coming from the fact that there's a place on the far east, and it's not that a lot of people look at self-interest.
And it's strange, but it's one of the world's greatest hazards of living in places that share other ideas.
And that starts everywhere, between liberals and civilizations, rich and poor and Westerners and Westerners.
We're starting to form a group of things that are formed, and we're going to form them, and we're going to compress them about other things.
And I don't think it's important for me to remember that these cultural attitudes of writing can lead to the greatness of these cultural arts.
Stories don't distribute borders, but our minds can also turn on the sky.
And by looking at these things, we can see other worlds, and we can love what we see.
I started writing stories from age eight.
And one day, my mother told me that my wife, in the brown color, gave me a surprise, and she said that she would write my personal stories here.
Now I'm thinking, at the time, I'm afraid I'm thinking about it.
Stories were good for me to tell my family at home, but it wasn't good if I didn't talk to my friends who weren't telling them about stories.
I was a kid who was a subway kid who was going to talk to her smugglers, and I was an inrovcer kid, and my mother thought it was okay for me to write my everyday impressions.
But he didn't know that I thought my life was so intense, and what I wanted to do was to write about this unthinkable life.
Instead, I started writing about myself, not about myself, but about other things.
That's what I started writing about colonial love.
It was the stories of other people, other people, other people, than the bush for me to write about.
Just take a jar: What happens if I'm going to take a bow and try and explain it to you?
And there was another thing that happened in this community.
My mother became my mother's bottomloat.
And I also came out of this tiny, middle-class environment, and I was in Madrida, and I was the only Turkish school in school.
"I've been able to see it as a difficult thing to say to you here."" And there were kids in the classroom who had all of the deals, but there was this kind of hypothetocracy that didn't mean what was happening in this cosmopian way."
In fact, in this mesh, the kids themselves were considered themselves as individuals, not themselves, but as much as they were.
We looked like the U.S., and it was also fun, and it didn't have a bad event for anyone to talk about, or it didn't fall from religion.
And it turns out that it's always coming out to be a child, and it's always gone down.
And I remember when I was in this school, when I was in Turkey, there was a military military coming out to kill the Pope in Turkey, and Eurvioiiian music started collecting the Turkine Bridge 10.
(Laughter) I used to spend a lot of time thinking about being a marine school.
For the first time, I saw cultural sterotters in school.
"All of my kids would ask me about ""Midnig Extress,"" and they asked me how many cigarettes a day, and they asked them, ""Well, I've taken all kinds of cigarettes, so they've taken all the Turks out of the world, and they've asked me if they're starting to knit my head."
I've learned about three sterile stocks of Turkey, and these are: politics, cigarettes and cohesion.
And after Spanish, we went to Germany and German and again.
And when I thought that my imagination and my imagination were the only journey that I could ever carry with myself, all of these expeditions.
Stories give me the sense of persistence and perspectives — that I was poor in real life.
When I was 20, I moved to the city I loved so much.
I lived in a very cosmopsy environment and a live environment, and I wrote my novel here.
I was there when 1999 was a earthquake earthquake.
This is what I saw when I was coming out of three years in the morning, and I looked at it.
There was a big old seller, an old seller, not selling in the store, not talking to the edges and the marjinal lives.
At first, it was a long black party, it sat down next to a tuberculus, and it was a little bit black.
And I've seen that he's offering the cigarette that he's coming out of his pocket and he's going to offer it to him, and here's the idea that, in the middle of the zeros, he's sitting in the middle — the transfers that are networking with the gorrifts that are selling with the sake.
When we're confronted with death and wreck, we're all going to see the difference, and we're all going to be one for a few hours.
But I always believed that stories have similar effects.
I don't want to say that the magic is powerful, but when you read a good novel, we go away from our little comfortable room, we're starting to recognize people that we're never in the snow of the night and sometimes we're not familiar with the good ideas about.
And after that, I went to Boston, and I went to the college of girls from Missance.
It wasn't geological, it was just that change from the language look.
I started writing English.
They ask me why I don't write English. They ask me why I don't write English. My writing helps me change my language.
I love to write in Turkey, and my writing is more synthetic and ephetic. I love writing English, and I think it's more mathematical and irrational.
I think I'm always connected to anyone else.
I later learned English as millions of people in the world, and I later learned English, and English language is later.
When you learn the language of things later, you're always trying to lose what they're learning.
And as they come back, we want to talk more, we want to try to make better words, we're less advising, because there's a huge difference between our brains and our language.
That's the fear that we're facing.
But if we learn to be afraid of it, it might be a staggering to us.
That's what I learned in the Boston — it was a wreck of wreck and progress that I lived in.
I've been able to dive into my grandmother's everyday day and I've never been worried about my work, and I've been able to get into my house, and I've been able to get into a room for a while after his idea is only coming.
I lived my family because God loved my grandmother.
(Laughter) But instead of trying to make a decision together, I went to Ariza.
And because my wife was in the wishfulness, I started to go between Arizona Stanbul, and try to figure out, I couldn't feel as much as this difference in the world at two different points.
I always thought I had a part of me moved and moved from the physical and soul.
My stories are always coming to me to keep my lives and my parts.
And I'm trying to figure out that when we connect the story with more real than the story, it's magic.
I'd like to give you an idea of this issue.
One of my articles that I wrote in English is that when we see light in America, one of the people in the world, it's found that it's something like this.
"He said, ""I'd like you to know what you're going to do."" "It's a little bit different.""
(Laughter) I asked him what to mean.
"He said, ""Well, there's a lot of Spanish, but there's only Tanzanians, but there's Tanzania, and he's actually a guy."" In fact, Boston campus led by the University of Campus, because there are more than any other milliseconds in Turkey, but I think it's okay to understand what the Bible means."
But I know I'm always going to hurt him.
He wanted it to be my personal manual.
She wanted to be a woman in the book because I was a Nigerian woman.
I always talk about stories changing the world, and we can see that politics has impact impacted the way the Brothers spread, and how they fall apart.
Many of the writers, especially not from the New Yorkers, are often dismissed to this tongue.
If you're women, like me, who are from Islam, they're expecting you to write about Islam women, that's much better than women are happy.
They're expecting you're more likely to be more likely to be more likely to be more than to be more interesting, sad, aggressive, aggressive, aviances.
When I was a kid, Madrid, I've seen baseball as well in literature in our world.
It's not like the creators who have personal ideas, but the creators of civilization and countries, and a few of them from China, a few of them from Turkey, Nigeria.
They're expecting us to be different, not to be able to fit our culture.
In 1984, when I took interviews from the writer and traveler James Ballw, they asked him a few times about homosexuality.
"The guy who was trying to value him as a blue writer was based on Ballwin, and he said, ""You know, I don't have anything else except except?"" And I've had the same thing with every other person that I've ever had."" When he tagged us, our liberty is underbelly."
There's an extraordinary triqoria, where all of the writers have not been invented from the West, which is called literature.
About 10 years ago, I remember reading about the first few people on Harvard Money.
We were three writers, one of the people from the Flippers, and I went from Turkine to Indonesia.
(Laughter) But we didn't seem to be able to bring us together, and we didn't know if we were born.
We only had passets.
In other words, they're expecting people to write real stories.
It's happening in a very different way.
And it's not just writers like this, but it's the fact that the characters of the characters are becoming more mass.
Well, I think the story is that the story isn't there, but it's not there in the West.
That's what it is all around the world.
I saw this for the first time in 2005, when the Indian characters came to trial for their heroes.
I've come to realize that I've written a lot of books about women's eyes and religion's family, and I've written a lot about them.
When my little story became prosecuted, my little story became a big financial problem.
Some of the people that I've heard about the conflict of Turkey, and I've heard about it, and some of them have failed me.
But I'd like to tell you two sides of that moment, which is just literature.
Just a story.
"I don't just want to say, ""I just want to say a story,"" but I don't want to go down what I'm saying."
I'm surrounded by love and supporting the magic, not because they think about it, but because of how it is.
The writers are known to see the politics, but the political books are enough, today, the language of literature is not the language of everyday black.
"Chaxov would say, ""Well, it's a whole new way of trying to figure out what we're going to do."
"And it's the work of art."" And it's the work of art."
One makes it more than one.
The second difference is different.
One pulls the front.
The second one describes the front.
I've spent a lot of time doing things.
In fact, it's from the cathedar water.
"There were people who were telling me a story called ""The Buddhist."" And they were told stories of people in the audience, in the audience, in the audience, in the audience, in the audience, they were very lucky."
In the story, they changed their voices to express different perspectives, mimicking them.
It's what everyone would like to listen to, to hear it, to be ordinary people, to be stubborn, to no doubt.
"It would have cross borders. It would have been like the ""Molla Nolla,"" where the Middle Ages, North Africa, Blanks and Aide."
Today, stories continue to cross borders.
They listen to Palestinian and Israeli politicians when they talk to each other, but the Palestinian readers of the Palestinian readers as well as the Palestinian writer readers, and the Palestinian book readers, connect with the story story.
In fact, the Cathemat had to make us more space.
If it doesn't do that, it's not good.
books have saved me — and I've been able to find myself in a period of time, and I don't know what's going to be embarrassed.
But there's a danger to convey books.
After the writer and his spiritual path, Sumas Termin, my first job was to watch his book in the water and destroy his book.
"They say, ""Well, it's more than you can't get away from you."" The problem of cultural arts today is not the lack of wisdom and wisdom, and we know a lot about each other, and we think we know a lot more about it. We're not moving away from our knowledge, we're not moving away from others, we're connecting to others."
There's an analogy that I love: It's about acting as a composition.
One of the great things is that it's fixed.
On the other hand, it's always going on, and it's all going on.
And that's what my work looks like.
And part of what I'm writing is that it's rooted in Tiblia, and the other part is the world around, and it's the relationship between different cultures.
And in this sense, I think the work of my work is the local, and I think it's also the case that it's everywhere.
You'll probably be surprised to see that you'll probably have a Topkinkini Saray, who's been traveling along with this expedition, and there's been a mass of the 1400-year-old Osmany Planet.
There's a place in the middle of the village called the Jacuppers in the room.
That's the place between buildings.
I'm very interested in this approach.
And we don't believe in anything or something.
And what we're doing is we've evolved from the surface of the world, and we've been able to figure out what's happening when we've changed, and we're going to think about the kinds of creatures that are symbolized as a symbol for the world.
And I think it should be in the middle of my artists, and I think it should be in the middle of artists.
When I'm writing, I'm thinking about change, and I'm super-intelligent.
I love to think about it after 10 pages.
I love the characters that made me feel my love.
In one of my romance, I'm going to be talking about women, and there's going to be a great woman who's going to be happy, and there's going to be some kind of blue guy who's in the Norden bombsight.
As far as we can see, we can see about everything.
"Audo Lorde said, ""We're in the middle of our ancestors, and I'm saying, ""I'm walking around, and he says, ""I'm sorry, I don't know."" I think it was a great example."
And I don't think it's because we still write about what you know when you're a writer.
Maybe it's not very good for the beginning.
It's not about who we are, what we know and who we are.
We need to teach young and young people to write about what we're feeling clearly.
We need to move away from the rhetoros, we need to know other worlds.
It's like skin tiles that draw circles, moving through time.
They're putting together all of humanity, and they're putting together the meaning of humanity. And that's good news.
"I'd end with an ancient waterfall, and I'd say, ""You know, we'll be friends, we'll love business; love love it; the world is."" Thank you very much."
(Applause)
My great idea is a small idea that we can imagine hundreds of millions of ideas in us.
That's my little idea.
(Laughter) (Applause) The women who are here in the group are women. No matter.
The women are the women.
And I was trying to challenge the value of the world.
Two and a half years ago, I lost my exhaustion.
My head was hit by five building blocks, sadness, right-handed.
And I started to realize the value of this thing.
And then I've looked at it, and I've talked to doctors, scientists, and as a result, I can tell you that being more product is the only way to be happy is to say normal, to be happy.
(Applause) And that's what we're going to do.
Normally we're going to be the most or the most.
(Laughter) (Applause) Because sadly, the men say less or less, they're considered acceleration for men.
And recently, when I was trying to figure out how to kill one person, the next night, it started to talk about four hours.
"And I'm not sure I'm saying — I'm not saying, ""You know."
"What would it be like for five hours?"" (Laughter) Most of the people are less likely to sleep if they were five hours?"
"I'm here to invite him to come up here in the morning and say, ""What's Sat eight?"" And if you ask them, ""Well, what's the hell's the hell?"" And they'll say, ""It's too late, but it's not, it's a little bit of a tennis, it's going to say, you'll call them somewhere."" And they'll say, ""Well, I don't think they've done it, but I think they've done a lot of economic and economic leaders in the world."
If you go up, you have the IQ.
Not to be a good leader, but to be a good leader, it's to see before we touch Titanic.
It's enough for the months that we're moving our rivers.
I think Lhman Brothers, who's a big investment bank. (Laughter) If they were Lhman Brothers and sisters, they would still be right.
(Applause) Girls and girls were seven hours a day doing 24 hours a.m., seven hours a day or eight hours a day, and she would see the skyscrapers, and maybe she would understand what it would cause.
And in one of the things that we've been confronted with a lot of people, it's the best for the whole world, everything that's benefited from us to our lives, to our lives, to our influence, to our lives.
And one more thing I'm showing you is that the eyes of the door, the devices, the power of the imagination, to see the big ideas in you.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I was as a child as a child to have the body of a woman.
If you think about the brain, you can imagine that the brain is made up of two dimensions.
Don't forgive me for a minute. Thank you very much.
The information that's becoming energy is spreading all the systems of life simultaneously, and it tells us how it feels, how it feels, how it sounds, how it sounds, how it sounds.
We're one of the energy that's connected with the energy of our right brain through its skin.
At this point, we're perfect, absolutely beautiful.
There's a hemisphere where our brain is in a completely different place.
He thought about sub-Saharan Africa.
And our left brain thought of language.
The only thing I can do is foreign energy — it was power.
"And I said to myself, ""What did I see?"
I'm just feeling light. I'm glad.
