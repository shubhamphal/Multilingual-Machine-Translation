I'm going to talk about unprecedented images today.
I'm working on solar technology now.
And my little start point is to turn ourselves into strength, and that's how to do it.
So, let's look at different patterns for that.
This is just a little video about what we do.
Oh, here's a moment.
It can take a little bit of time.
(Laughter) We're just — let's pass this part — I'm just going to pass over the part of the video ... (Laughter)
No. (Laughter) (Laughter)
(Music) That's not ... (Laughter)
Okay. (Laughter)
The solar technology.
Oh, my time is over?
Okay. Thank you very much.
(Applause)
So I want you to look at what you're doing.
We're going to go back to this in a few minutes later. I hope that if you learn to protect your body a little bit, it will really improve your life.
We're very interested in language, especially in other people's language.
There are some reasons why we care about: (Laughter) whether it's unstable or laughing, unimportant sight or worrying expectation, or something just like anger.
Narrator: Now, they're coming to a 10-year-old home.
This lucky police gets the hands of the U.S. president.
We collect ourselves. We collect ourselves.
We go out.
We're trying to be invisible for the man around us.
As you can see, animals and humans still do the same thing.
When it comes to strength and force, it comes out of that environment.
When we're lucky, we're starting to finish other people's lives.
So, if anyone uses all the power to us, we're trying to collect it. We're not doing it.
In fact, we're going to look at his power.
I've seen that MBA students are developing a lot of power levels.
Some of them put themselves as a leader, when they go into the school room, go right in the middle of the ocean, place themselves before they're going to school.
They're going to replace almost two people.
They're going to take them out of that way.
I had a few reasons for myself.
The first is that it's not going to surprise you.
It's estimated that it's about violence.
So women look at people a lot more like this.
Girls are feeling more compassionate than people, and it's not compassionate.
And it's very important for these MBA students, because it affects the benefits of education.
Social schools are always affected by gender.
The people and women who are preparing for the same question get different benefits at the end of the course, and it seems to be linked to the involvement.
And I started to think about myself, and let's see that those of you who go in this way are more active in education.
So if they're showing these videos, and they're going to be more active at the study if they want them to look like this?
So if we take a short period of time to show ourselves strong, can we feel stronger because of the difference in our behavior?
So we know that our structure and structure are defining other people's thoughts and parts about us, and there's a lot of evidence of that.
But the question that really cares about us is that architecture doesn't influence ourselves.
I mean, that's actually happening in both ways.
It's also about power.
When we feel strong and confident, we're fruitful of a lot more powerful, but when we try to be strong, we're feeling strong.
What do we do when we think about the sense of power?
I talk about ideas and particles, and about physiological things that combine them, and that's why they're hormones. I'm learning hormones.
What's going to change the minds of forces and forces?
But only 60 percent of the people who are in the power position, and that's important.
And that's what we've shown in testosterone.
Since the time they've gone, I've gone up with about 20 percent in the temperature of the temperature, and others have been about 10 percent higher.
And it's going to be able to do these changes for two minutes.
And that's what happens in the cortex.
In the cortizol of those who are in the power position, there's about a quarter-century increase, and there's a quarter-century increase.
It's about two times moving towards these harmonical changes to make our brains feel more ambitious, healthier and comfortable, but stressed and cold.
These particles meet us all, right?
I mean, sometimes our language defines how to think and feel about ourselves, so the extra-verbals aren't just for others.
Some of us are also changing our minds.
And the next question that's paying attention to us is that we can take a few minutes of power in a very significant way to change our lives.
This is a two-minute experiment that started in the lab.
And what about doing this in real life?
And of course, that's what matters us very much.
In our sense, these positions can be used to be used in terms of the creation of social issues.
So what about the map?
This is the kitchen table for innovation.
For some of them, these are school meetings.
It's a job interview for some of them, or it's a job interview.
We thought it would encourage a lot of you to do this, because it's a lot of you doing this.
"So we published our findings, the media expanded them, and what the jusrillists said, "What do we do when we go to a business interview?"
(Laughter) Of course, we rejected this idea. No! Of course not! We didn't even notice it.
That's what you're doing!
It's not with others.
It's about your connection to yourself.
What do you do before the interview begins?
You're sitting. You're looking at your phone or Android.
You look at your results, you jump, you collect yourself, and actually what you have to do is that, as you're sitting on the foot, stay just like that.
That's what we wanted to do.
Now, the engineers went to the lab and went to a very, very hard job study after we got a position of strength and insecure.
Five minutes later, the interview was taken into a video.
They were taught to use a non-verbal tool to prevent the impact of the audience. They looked like this.
In five minutes, it's easier to look at an emotional face than to stay on the ground.
Nobody likes that.
"(Laughter) This is called ""Stop in social space."" It increases the amount of cortizol in humans."
We took them from a study like this to see what they're looking at.
And then we showed the code four of these extractedations.
They weren't familiar with our expectations.
"They didn't know who had any advantage."" After we looked at the video, they showed people who said, ""We want to take these things to do it.""
We don't want to take these things.
"And they're better before."" What's going to do with that?"
It's not because of their essence.
It's based on what they're moving into.
We've also looked at the other indicators of them, so how accurate are the numbers?
What qualities do they have?
There was no difference between those indicators.
And that wasn't what was important.
People just show real faces.
So, they're showing themselves.
We don't notice their ideas, they're showing themselves.
And that's actually the effect.
"And when I say to people, how we think, how we think, how we behave, how we can change our consequences, ""Is that not a bit of damage?"" I'm also."
I'm going to say, imagine it until it's true.
"""I'm not like that."
I don't want to feel something real.
I don't want to be a fraud.
"I don't want to be anywhere that doesn't help me.""
"I'm going to deal with this very well. I want to talk to you about a little story about the feeling of ""I'm not my place.""
When I was 19, I had a very heavy car crash.
It's taken out of the bus.
I've been here a few times.
I was playing in the education of mental intelligence, and I had to leave the teacher, and I found that the IQ rate fell down by two indicators, which was very painful for me.
I was born because I was recognized as a kid who was smart and willing to be a kid.
Because I went out of college, I tried to go back.
"They said to me, ""You don't want to end the college."
"What you're going to know is a lot, but the college isn't love."" And I started to worry about it, and I said, ""The most important qualities that you have, for me, are my anger, and nothing can help you, like being taken from you."
I felt completely compassionate.
I worked, I worked, I worked on my own hand, and I lost nothing to do.
So I finished a teacher.
"I had to spend about four years from my group colleagues, and I agreed to take myself to the University of Prison, who was a teacher, Susan Falcon, who was a teacher, and I went to ""Where I wasn't.""
I was in prison.
This is my first course interview in Princeton in about 20 minutes that 20 people listen to.
It was the first night.
"And I was so afraid that the morning was going to open, and I asked my government, "I can't know it anymore."" He said to me, ""No, if you're going to, I've come to your room very much."
You're going to stay and say what I'm going to say.
It's okay.
You're going to take all the questions you're going to do.
"And again, you're afraid, and you're afraid and you're afraid of it, so you can't listen to me, ""Well, I'm not going to look at it!"
"It really came from me."" You're going to work as long as you're going to say."" And I did that."
Five years ago, I've been looking at the big pill of art school. For a few years, I've been in Northwest, I've been in Harvard, and I've been there. But I don't think about it, but for a long time, I thought, "I'm not my place.""
"And at the end of the first year I was at Harvard, I went to my college, who had never been at school for a year, and said, "You're not going to join you or you're going to be willing."" I didn't know it well."
"He came in and said, ""Well, it's not my place."
And that's a change point for me.
Because two things happened.
First of all, I realized that I didn't even have that sense.
But he felt, and those particles met me.
Secondly, I realized he was in the right place.
So he could look at it by imitating it.
"And I said to him, ""No, it's all love for me!"
"It's going to show you as I'm here in the morning, it's going to show you strong, and (Applause) You're going to go into the school room and give you the best gift that you've ever given today."" And he did that. She didn't know that she was sitting here. (Laughter) A few months later she came to me and looked at her, not until she felt real, but how much she could simulate."
It was changed.
And I'd like to tell you that.
Imagine it as far as possible.
Just show yourself until you're somebody you want to be.
I want you to know.
Now, these simple corrections can lead to such big changes.
Now, I've been talking about two times ago.
Two times, two times, two times.
Take this for two minutes before you're going to look at the sky, and try to do it in the car, in the room, around the table, next to the door.
Take what you want to do.
Imagine your brain going to be the best thing to do.
increase your testosterone. You've also reduced your cortizol.
"""Okay, I didn't show them what I was able to do."" You don't want to stop waiting."
"You can see, ""I'm going to reach them and show them what I am!""
I'd like you to share it with others, just as you can't apply those forces, because it's very simple.
It's not self-reaching. (Laughter) So, share this with people, and share it with people, because people who can do it are just people who don't have access to technology and resources and status and trust.
And share it with them so that anyone can use it.
Because, in fact, two minutes of attention to their bodies can really impact their lives.
Thank you.
(Applause)
We have a lot of dragonflies in the world.
And the top of their superglasses is invisible.
The catators are the workers who collect materials that are recycled to live.
The catators have a tough, honest and necessary act that helps all of them, but they don't be thanked for that.
Here, in Brazil, 90 percent of the products that are recycled — why they collect.
There's a lot of catadors that are working on. They're flying out of the cows, and they're going to go back to prison schools.
Karroaches remember Brazil's cars that are made of paper or metals, from a few little bit of it, and the cart of gravity and tiny art.
And that's why I couldn't meet these supercriminals.
I'm a politician and an activist, and I'm a politician, and I'm a politician, and I'm a politician, and I'm a politician, and I'm a politician, and I'm a politician, and I'm a politician, and I'm a politician, and I'm a politician, and I'm a politician, and I'm a politician, and I'm a politician, and I'm a politician, and I'm a politician, and I'm a politician, and I'm a politician.
In 2005, I turned my job from dragonflies to dragonflies to dragonflies for reasons for the city's life.
But I've also supported the catators.
And I was more interested in looking at my work and looking at the eggs, and it helped me bring these catators into the center of attention and raise their confidence for themselves.
Today, they're young in public and social media.
So, since I met this world, I've always been working on this.
I didn't have more than 200 cars in many cities, and I was invited to a lot of travelers and travelers around the world.
And I found out that with invisible images, the catators just say about Brazil.
I found them in countries that evolved like Argentina, Chile, South Africa, including Japan and the U.S.
And then I realized that more people should be involved in this, because it was a big job.
"After that, I've created a lot of fun under the title of ""Pimp My Carroça."" (Laughter) It's a lot of compassion that we can afford by the community."
Thank you.
(Applause)
"Now, it was a great gift for the people who were created to help the catators and the dragonflies."
The catalyst has been supported by teachers, hospitals, pediatrics, hairstyleists, massage therapists, famous professionals and healthcare professionals like this.
So, when the dragonflies were rescued by our dragonflies, they were given their brains to see the protective roots, even the beach and the city that didn't rain.
They also took other tools for information: fascinating lentils, architects and puzzles.
And finally, they'd become part of this wonderful, big cultural journey, standing up with little dragonflies.
"""Before I'm looking at the cart,"" Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Kuribita went to the smallest."
We created a Pimpx, which is an easy, affordable, affordable version of the people who are outside America, inspired by TEDx to explore their education.
So, he would be able to put it all together.
Over two years, 170 katators, 800 graduates and 200 young teachers, and more than 1,000 donor donors have been brought to the charity, and they have been trained to live in local schools with their help.
Because when the catators left the invisible back, they were people who were compassionate and worthy of respect.
They're able to look forward to the unprecedented dragonflies, and they're able to increase their income and their impact on society.
Now, I'm asking you to find katators in your village and other invisible superconductors and recognize them.
Try to see the world as a whole without rules and curves.
Don't believe if you want, there's more than 20 million katators in the world.
When you see someone like him, you know them as a vital part of our own life.
Thank you very much. Bigado.
(Applause)
On November 5th, 1990, a man named Al-Saiid Nosair went to the hotel in Manhattan to RavvinMe Canyon — the leader of the Jewish University of Technology.
Now, Nosair was not guilty of the genocide, but when they were going to fight against the northeast conflicts, with other partners in New York, they set up attack plans for a number of governments: tunels, dragonflies and the U.N. front conflicts.
Fortunately, plans were under-the-lineed by the F TB customer.
But unfortunately, in 1993, the World Trade Center couldn't prevent bombing.
And finally, Nosair was completely angry at the end.
My father, Sir Sid Nosair, is my father.
In 2003, in Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania, Pittsburgh, I looked at the world as an honor of a mysterious engineer and a proud American, a modern school teacher, and I didn't want to come to me to live a happy kid.
When I was seven years old, my family started to change.
My father led me to seeing the fact that Islam, many women, is a very few people.
And I learned this from the experience of nature: people don't have long time to understand that each other has the same effects of our lives, after getting familiar with each other so much.
In every language, in every country, there may be a little bit of time for people who have the right to believe in each country, and who have the right to take others into their own lives, who have the right to take the right to the other.
A few months ago, my father went to me and told me that in the last few weeks, with his friends, they went to pollinators in London Island.
And I said I'm going to go with him tomorrow.
We went to the Calverton Falcon College, and we didn't know that there was a secret witness of F TB at the time.
When my father came to me, my father helped me keep a hole in my flower, and he figured out how to deal with the 30 meters of light.
The last smile that I went on that day came up with a little sparkling lamp on the sky, and then it was a dragonflies, and it was all surprised to do that, especially I.
"And I went back to other people and said, ""Isan Abuh."" He said, ""It's the horse of his father."
They all laughed at that word, but a few years later, I realized what they really laughed.
They thought that my father was great, and what he saw was great.
Finally, these people were familiar with the 700 kilograms of gravitational particle, which was covered by the World Trade Center, where six people died, and more than 1,000 people were wounded.
These people are the ones that I've taken to me.
"It's like this."" It's the people I call."
As I was 19 years old, we changed our home for 20 years, and it caused me to have a few of my friends who were long as I was a kid.
It would be one of the things that we can't get closer to myself and go to other places.
As a new person, I've always been turned into the foundation of the kids that you're doing.
I kept my identity secret from my classmates to not be in the digital community, but it was so clear that it was enough to be the most hidden and darkest of a new student.
So I spent a lot of my time reading books at home, watching movies or playing games.
So there were conflicts in my social community benefits, and I wasn't really prepared for life as a fanist family growing up.
I grew up in a society where people were justified as religion and religion.
So what happened when I opened my eyes?
One of my first lessons that led me to this kind of thought was the time of the government's election in the 1970s.
I've lost the opportunity to participate in the National University Foundation in Philadelphia in preparation for the university.
As I think of the country I've been in front of, I've driven violence between the children, and I'm not too much of the violence of the children who are doing so much of their lives.
They were people who had a different way of living in our community.
I learned that one of the kids I met in the last days of the law was Jewish.
This fact was only discovered for a few days, but I realized that there was no tolerance between each of us.
I didn't have been a Jewish friend before, and I said it's okay, and I felt angry because I knew the barry that I had never been told for my lifetime.
One more important point of transformation was the work that I found for additional savings in the busch Garden's recreation park in the Yayda.
I was based on people with different beliefs and cultures, and it played a very important role in the development of my experience.
I've learned that a big part of my life is the fault of justice, and also that all the dragonflies have the meaning of self.
And it turns out that I had the opportunity to work with gay artists at one stage, but by the way, many of them are the most compassionate and vulnerable people I've ever seen as they're going down.
I've discovered that, as a kid, I've been very interested in, I'm going to take a sense of being able to fight other people's lives, and it's a sense of giving me a gift that I don't want to do with myself.
And I'd like to compare stereotypes that I've learned from my childhood to really the experience of life.
I don't know how it sounds like, but I'm very familiar with what it's because of reasons that don't depend on you.
"And then, ""The Daily Show."" Now, Con Stüart helped me to be honest with myself about what I was interested in fanatics, and to convince me that human moral, religious and sexual orientation wasn't relevant to his moral quality of society."
Now, Con Stüart, when my father needed me, was actually a parent of the word.
The inspiration came out of nowhere that's not been lost for a long time, and the fact that the Jewish comedian had a better impact on my worldview than my extremist father was.
One day of the day, I was praised by me about the change of my world's perspective, and he told me a promise that I couldn't come out of my life.
"My mother looked at me with the eyes of tiredness, as a man who lived enough in his life, and said, "I'm tired of hating people.""
And I realized how powerful energy it was to produce when I learned about the sense of hating at a moment.
My father is not a real step.
I changed my name when I decided to deal with my father and start a new job.
So why did I get rid of myself, and why did I get rid of the danger?
It's very simple.
And I hope that somebody who's more powerful, maybe ever, has heard about my story, and it's important that there's a better way, but I'm not fanatic, but I'm not going to go to a non-tolerant ideology.
In fact, I decided to use the science that I lost as a result of terrorism and fanalism.
I do it with terror victims and their blessings, the terrible pain and the destruction that terrorism lives to them.
I'm going to encourage my father's actions that don't underestimate this kind of terrible act for terror victims.
As a simple example of my advice, I'm a living proof that violence is not supposed to listen to and pass out of race, and that the son is not supposed to go through his father's path.
I'm not like my father.
Thank you very much. (Applause) Thank you very much. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)
Thank you for the morning!
Are we there?
They took a step-by-shaped light on them, but I wanted to ask you. Who here wrote his name in Arabic on his voice?
Who wrote? Who? Yeah, there's no problem.
A few days ago, I was sitting in the restaurant with my friend and offering food.
"I looked at the office, and I said, "Do you have a teacher? (Laughter)"
He looked at me so excited when he thought he had heard the word.
"He said, ""Come on? (In English)" And I said, ""Menyu, no, no compassion."" He said, ""What do they say to him, you don't know?"" "I know.""
"He said, ""No! It's called ""In English,"" or ""In English."" Is my French vocabulary right?"
"He said, ""Well, let's work with this!"" He said, ""Come on."
"He was tired of talking to me. He, I know, told myself, "If he was the most angry girl in this world, I wouldn't look at him!""
What does it mean if you don't really say the word ""Menu?"
In two words, the young boy of Lebanon, who was left and sent out as ignorant.
How could he talk like this, right?
At that moment, I started thinking.
And that made me feel like this.
That's really the impact of the man!
They don't admit me because I speak in my own language.
Is that going to start on another map?
How did we think about it?
But most of us here, like me, there are many people in their lives who get to a point in their lives that they're not only the most likely to do anything that's going on in the past to know they're important and that they're social.
Should I forget all my laws, all my ideas, all my health and emotions?
Children's interests about history may have been our best benefits!
I've learned in Arabic just to adapt everything.
Should I forget to be one of them?
Did I have hard here?
But despite all of that, I tried to deal with him.
I didn't want to judge him with the courage that he made me justice.
English doesn't respond to the importance of this day.
It's not the language of my hand, the language of education, or the language that we're paying for to provide a large-scale research technology that we're used in our universities, and it's not the language that we use in our airports.
If we were doing that, they would print our shoes.
Why should I use my language? We should not all give that water!
You want to use English. Where should we use it?
It's a reality.
But we have another more important reality that we should think.
English is the main language.
In the survey, you have to be perfect in your parent to know that you can't be perfect in other languages.
In the main words, excellence is essential to not express ideas in other languages in a creative way.
How?
When the Koran begins to write the Koran for the first time, he uses English.
He was inspired by a little boy in the village, who had all his ideas, all his thoughts, all his thoughts and all his curiosity, who had a special impact.
So when he started writing in English, he had enough basis.
But when he writes in English, when he read his writing, you're feeling that much, you're going to pass those pieces.
You can imagine that there's the same boy from the mountains of Odur, which is written in English.
It's a miracle that nobody will be afraid.
Secondly, it's often said that if you want to kill a nation, the only way you can't kill a nation is to kill his language.
This is a reality that developed societies know.
The Germans, the French, the crops, the Chinese — these nations are the importance of this race.
So they're allowed to protect their own languages.
They're doing this.
So they're using language, and they're spending a lot of money to improve language.
Do we know more than them?
Well, we're not from the developed world, but we're not going to come to us thinking about this story, and we're going to stand up with the political world.
And once we had research, but for development, the countries that were standing in those countries, the countries like Malaysia and so forth, they took their language with themselves, and they didn't get it.
They kept the language close to themselves.
Because if you take a product from the country or anywhere else, and there's no label on it in the country, OK, it's not the local product.
You didn't believe it was a local product.
They were consumers as they used to be, as we used to be, unacceptable consumers.
So they had to protect their own languages to develop and to implement.
"If I say, ""In fact, corruption, corruption,"" what will this remind you of?"
But what doesn't remember, right?
Nobody, even though how and why it is.
It's not only the way words come out of our mouth, it's not the tool for speech.
The language represents a terminology that's connected to certain aspects of our lives and our emotions.
"And perhaps, when we say, ""The lack of dignity, the lack of dignity, the equality,"" each of you has different images in your mind, and in particular, there are specific parts of the day."
It's not a single, two or three words, or a whole combination.
It's a fundamental idea of how we think, how we see each other, how others see us.
What's an insect?
Why can you tell you that this person's going to deal with, right?
"Because if I say, ""In shortness, dignity, justice,"" or if your son comes and says, "Oh, do you live in education?""
How do you feel?
If you don't see the problem, it's good that I'm going to go out and not talk to the empty place.
The hope is that these expressions remind us something special.
I have a French friend who is married in France.
I asked him one day, how are things going on?
"He said, ""It's good. But I've tried one day to fix the word ""the letter"" for him all night."" (Laughter) (Applause) (Applause) So the woman wrote to him called ""the letter,"" and then he tried to explain the word for the whole night."
"He said, ""How can man be so curious?""
Does he want to suicide?
""It's me? (In English)" It's one of a few missiles."
So we started to think that because she's not going to deal with her, she can't tell her that word, and she's willing to deal with her, and she's thinking about it.
"And my husband said to me, ""He's going to listen to the Pharaoh, and I'm going to try one night to convince him that when I listened to fairness, he's going to feel what I felt."" The woman wrote to him trying to do this for him: "I've extended my hand and I've been my son."" (Laughter) And that's the problem: "And because I'm familiar with them, I've taken my hands back and left you." (Laughter)"
Imagine it for me.
(Applause) What did we do to love English?
We turned it into the law of the government, and we started to Congress to protect the language of the government.
"For example, a lot of people told me, ""What are you going to worry about?"
"Don't forget it, and don't worry about it."" There's no problem!"
"And that's what the foundation for protecting your language was: "I'm talking to you about the public, and I'm responding to me from the Bible.""
"We didn't say, ""No! We don't accept it or it."" We didn't choose that way, because they didn't deal with us."
And if anyone talks to me in that way, I hate English.
We say, (Applause) We want to change our own reality, and we want to change our dreams, our desire and our everyday lives.
We're going to be happy to think like us and think like us.
"Because, ""I talk to you about the community, but if you answer me from the Bible,"" it was a shame."
It's very simple, at the same time, creative and credible.
And then we started another company that was written in the box.
"You've already seen this pattern, and on the top of the white and yellow lens, it's written, ""Don't kill your song!""
Why? Actually, don't kill your language.
We don't have to kill our language from birth.
If we were to kill our language, we had to find our identity.
We had to find our ability.
We were going to go back at the beginning.
It's also important than losing our chance to be global and scientific.
After that, we've spread images of girls and boys who've gone across all of the continents.
"""Cool"" is a picture of girls and boys."
We were very good.
"And somebody says, ""Oh, you've been speaking English!"" I say, ""OK! I've lost the word ""God."" Now, if you want to reject it, they want to say, but let me tell you a better promise that it's going to show you a better reality."
"I'm going to continue to say, ""The Internet."" I don't say, ""I'm going to the world's grandmother."" (Laughter) Because that's not bad! We don't have to cheat ourselves."
But as we can see here, we have to believe that if we're speaking about it, we should not be able to persuade that we think that we're bigger or that we have a population in our face, that you can control us and think and feel what they want ourselves.
It's the idea of being creative.
If we can't fly to the universe, or we can't fix the rakiets, and so we can be creative.
Now, each of you is a creative project.
Creativity in your primary language is just a way.
Let's start from that moment.
Let's take a novel or take a little movie.
Now, the novel can also bring us back.
This language can go and go back to being a node.
"I mean, it's not easy to say, ""There's no answer."" There's a dropout."
But we have to know and believe that there's a search path, and that's our obligation to be part of the search path.
So what can you do today?
Tutes, who vibrate?
And if I'm in my time, I'm going to ask you a lot of time, whether it's English or French or Chinese.
But when you write in Arabic, you don't write in Arabic with the graph of Latin.
(Applause) That's crazy! That's not the language!
You go into the virtual world with virtual language.
It's not easy to fly back from that kind of place.
This is the first thing we can do.
Secondly, there's a lot of other things that we can do.
We're not connected here today to believe each other.
We're here that we're going to focus on the importance of protecting this language.
Now let me show you a circle.
She's the first time she knows her father in language.
"When my daughter was born, I'm going to say to him, ""This is your father, I'm good. (Laughter)" I'm going to say to him in English, ""This is your dad, honey."" And my daughter, Nura, I'm going to say, ""Be very good at the supermarket,"" and he says to him, ""Mercy, Maman,"" and I'm not going to want and I'm going to hope that nobody heard him."
(Applause) Well, let's take ourselves away from putting it into this technology. (Applause)
I learned a few things when I was doing these 30-day experiments.
For the experiment, I took a picture every day in a month.
I had 30 days before I started the experiment.
It's very bad.
In fact, they need a lot of fun.
(Applause)
Since I read a good school, my experience was great. I started to live with a student full of love, of love, of dragonflies and of course.
But most of all, it makes me feel very miserable, insecure, and I was afraid of the people who were involved, the ones that I felt in the future, and the space that I felt in.
"As you started, as I used to do before, I heard a very strange voice when I went out of the room, and I was like, ""She's going out of the room."" I was scattered."
There was no one on my side. The light and precision of the environment that I needed was absolutely accurate.
"""He opens his door."" I heard."
It was the beginning. It was the beginning.
And days ago, then weeks ago, I did everything, and the third person told me about the question.
"He goes to the machine.""
He asked his friend and his hopeful friend, and he was tough, and just a while later, and I thought, that's the same thing that I didn't get too much together at the time.
For my missionary, when I hide my own self and my real parts, because I was, it was a great thing.
And so what happened to me was that normal people didn't hear questions, and I didn't hear it in a serious position.
It's the experience that I've taken to my college.
Right, I needed this attention and the need of the village, and I started talking to him about my wonderful teacher.
"For example, I was working on a college TV as a computer reporter, and at night, when I went to the college's museum, I said, ""I'm going to go."
And then, it started to go out of my school very quickly.
I got stuck in the hospital, and then the schizophrenia diabetes was taken, and then the worst thing: an astonishing sense of dissonance, of compassion and of compassion, associated with myself and my future.
And it started to improve my passion and my motivation because I thought it was a new life experience, but because I was convinced that it was a cause.
It was a sort of mental challenge, a sort of emotional challenge towards this crying, and the result was that the number of questions started to rise, and it started to go down and down and down.
Do you see the rock of water in it?
In fact, there was a period of love, of humming, of immensity and of disagreement, and I wasn't at the time of creating peace and peace in this war that I felt miserable.
Two years later, my life started to collapse.
So I had all the dragonflies of the girl: great pictures, wonderful images, crazy, unprecedented numbers.
Now, when I look at the mountain and the despair of those years, I think one is dying, one is lost.
A person who was limited and tightly touched was sent to the head, and he looked at not to go out of that journey, and eventually to go back to someone I had to get more and more.
A lot of people have lost me all over my lifetime, and they're all reminded of me, but these things have been very, very miserable and vulnerable compared to the people who helped me.
I believe Eleanor's going to do that.
"And if some honey rains, then it's going to spread."" He said, ""I can't wait 14 minutes ago to thank these beautiful people who are suffering from me and me, waiting for me to go back and go back and look like I'm suffering from malaria."
Of course, it was hard to believe in this because the questions came down and was fascinating, so I didn't know how to express the first important thing that I thought I was telling me what I thought was like before.
For my missionary, I've learned to explain the questions about how to attack my house — not as a real and emotional damage, but as a sense of love and damage that I felt.
I really believed in them.
One morning, I'm still sitting in front of my grandmothers, and I'm reminded of the dragonflies to protect them from the questions that I really consider.
"Well, you can say, ""Don't work with me."
"Do you see I have a plastic patch?"" That's my strategy."
And after I realized that, unfortunately, I've gone back to psychiatry in a completely different role, taking myself out of particles now, getting rid of a very bizarre pattern.
Now, I'm afraid that I'm going to be a part of the foundation of the International Women of Story, and that's what I'm going to do with Professor Romme and Dr. Sandy Escher's work, which defines the future as a strategy for life, as a way of tackling compassion, not as an anomaly, but as a schizophrase, but as a difficult, important and important thing to learn.
What's possible for this kind of society, but it's also built.
There's a read statement in China that if there's a social change, there's no return.
It's not going to attract the poor.
But it's not going to give people who aren't afraid.
In the last 20 years, we're not going to spread from AIDS to five to 26 countries, and by working together, we're going to expand the opportunities of people who have compassion and compassion and courage and courage, and we're hopeful leaders and provedors, and we're going to support the human benefit of our imagination.
As Piter Levine said, it's an important creature that has digital spirit to use this tool that's available to human service instinct.
In this case, the greatest thank you for all of us is to help somebody who needs to provide, to be with, to expand, to share and hope for his suffering.
We're invisible. We're not disconnected.
It's not going to take or steal what's going on from us.
It doesn't sound like anything.
"As a good gentleman once said to me, ""Don't tell you what others say in your room."
"Talk about you."" Thank you very much."
(Applause)
I'm here to talk about my photography.
But is that a picture?
Because, of course, it's not a picture you can draw with your camera.
Again, my photographer started when I got my first picture at the age of 15.
I've taken this with my friend who was an early self, but in a little bit different way, because when I use the camera, I've designed the process a few years ago.
When you take a picture with the camera, it's ready when you print the picture of the machine.
For me, photography wasn't just about being in the right place at the right time.
I thought everyone could do that.
So I wanted to create something different, something that was beginning to happen after the images were taken.
So pictures like this: that's the key that works on a road.
But it was turned into an unprecedented game.
And yet, it looks really close.
Or pictures like this — both dark and colorful, but they're all going to keep quite a realization.
So, as I'm a realizator, I'm showing photography.
Because, of course, these are not really pictures that we can draw, but I'd like to have images that are visible to anyone with a camera.
I'd like to have pictures that you're going to think a little bit about to figure out where.
So it really involves keeping a better idea than keeping a moment.
Is it the object that allows him to look really?
Does it matter with these details or colors?
Does it matter?
What does it create?
Maybe it's about creating illusions.
But then, how did the world deal with, double-dimensional GDP, which is really important to make it real.
It's not really what this reality is, it's really what the real images are for us.
So the idea is very simple.
And I see it when I put it in a place of real science, creating a real inventor that I created an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
There's three-dimensional physical objects that can be measured by excellence, three-dimensional UVs that are relevant to our world.
But when it comes together in a certain way, it still looks like the three-dimensional structure that exists.
But we know that it doesn't exist.
So we're playing with our brains because our brains can't admit that it's not the essence of reality.
And I see the same process as I combine pictures.
It really involves combining different facts.
So what's real about a picture is what we don't think about, what's happening in our everyday lives, around us.
And when you put pictures together, it's really important to do this, because in fact, it seems to be wrong in some way.
And what I want to say is there are three simple things that we have to do to get a real reason.
As you can see, these images don't have a specific effect.
But when it's combined, something like this is taken.
So, first of all, the differences of the combined pictures have to be the same.
Secondly, the light of the combined pictures has to be the same.
And in these two ways, these two reasons have been added — from the same size and the same light.
Thirdly, it's to make the picture budget and make it possible to end on the map and separate that one starts out of the map.
It has to be combined in a way that can't be separated from how it's made.
In the context between these images, we remove the distance between the size and contrast and the brightness, using the size of space, the color left and the light, and using different images, and we allow it to look like a single image, but in some way, there are hundreds of different elements.
And that's another example.
(Laughter) People might think that's the main part of this, and that's the bottom of my altered circle.
But in fact, this picture creates a total combination of pictures of different places.
I think it's easier to create a place than to find a place, so you don't need to change your ideas even less.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And I knew that I had a few months since I was coming in the horizon, and I had a few months to find places that were going to finish the parts of the inventor in terms of planning and planning.
For example, the fish's main fish has been taken off.
And the continents are different continents.
Six dragonflies of water were taken in a wall.
And so I also paint the house on the surface of the island in red to look more Swedish.
So it's possible to get a really near cause, and I think it's possible at the number of planning.
It's always beginning with a breakthrough, with an idea.
And then we want to put together different pictures.
In this way, each piece is planned very well.
And if you take pictures very well, the reason can be very beautiful and also very realistic.
So we have all the resources that we need, and the only thing that makes us vulnerable is our moral power.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Chris Anderson: Julian, thank you.
There's a data given that Wikipedia, you know, has published more information than all the world's news published in the last year.
Is that possible?
Julian Assange: Yeah, can this be true?
Isn't it scary that the rest of the world's media works so bad? A small group of activists can spread more information than all the world's media.
CA: How do you do that?
How do people spread these data?
How does the equation mean?
JA: And as we know, these are the people who are missing data, and there's a different way to get these data to us.
We encode information to prevent surveillance, to easily spread on the Internet, and we call government governments like Sweden and Belgium to protect the law.
It encrypts information, or encrypts it, and it forms it in the same way as news agencies — it can be a little bit difficult when there's a great database — and we can explain to the government and protect ourselves from possible and political attacks.
CA: So you don't know who the data theory is for a long time.
JA: It's true. We rarely know them. If we find the data's foundation, we're completely eliminating that information.
(Applause) It's easy.
(Laughter) CA: Well, I was the CIA, asking TED the code of default. (Laughter)
And I think we're going to look at the dark missile.
This is the information that was discovered a few years ago.
So let's show you that.
It was a story from Kenya.
How can you talk about how you're not going to draw this story?
JA: This is the Kroll Report.
This was a survey taken by the government of Kenya after the 1980s election.
By 2004, Kenya was governed by Daniel Young Young 18 years ago.
He was my refugee dictator in Kenya.
When the power of the coalition went to the government of Kibabi and started talking about corruption, they published a report by using two million pounds.
They've also used this information as a political force in Kenya at that time and then as the most rich man, Moya.
This is what the original book of Kenya music is.
In 2005, I went to Kenya a few years ago from the 28th century elections, and I could get the results.
We published this report three days after the new president Kibabi Daniel Young Mo started to come to the money of the man who was going to go to the money, and after that event, the report came to the president Kibabian.
CA: The shortest of the long term — the report was not directly transferred to the Kenyan government, but it was carried out by roads, and I think it changed the implications of these projects.
JA: Yeah. Well, it was published in the headquarters of the Guardian recently, and then in countries around Kenya, Tanzania and Cambodia in Africa.
The news came out.
Within a few days, the Kenyan news started to make it easy about it.
Over the last 20 days, it was published in the Kenyan government, and it changed about 10 percent of the survey of the Kenyan health care department, and it led to change the results.
CA: So the data that you've discovered has really changed the world?
JA: Yeah.
(Applause) CA: Now, here's a video about the air cell in Baghdad.
The video is a little long. It's a little clip image.
First of all, there's a little violence in this video.
Radio: If it's smart, it's open up.
Now they're looking at, they're looking at Xammar.
It's the moon. It's the father.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Kick it all.
Oh, yeah, yeah!
(Applause the automated weapon) Take it, continue. (Applause the automated weapon) Yeah.
The hotel is Bushmaster Two-Six, Bushmaster Two-Six.
You had to go back.
We killed all eight people.
We've got two cylinders, and we're moving forward.
It was. They all died.
Two-Six, Two-Six, we're in action.
Oops. Thank you. What was that?
Zibil, Keith. Yes, it's okay, so it's okay.
CA: How did this picture look like?
JA: It's hard for people who are good at this.
Two people were sent in connection to this video survey.
This is actually one of three attacks in the video.
CA: If I don't worry about it, 11 people died in this attack with two users of Reuters, right?
JA: Yeah. Two Reuters workers died, two children died.
In fact, 18,000 people died.
CA: The publication of these things led to a huge impact.
So, what's the main reason for this frustration and happiness?
JA: I don't know just, but I think people have seen the unprecedented impact of power.
People who are comfortable with the color are laughing with 30mm-year-old telescope flying above them — but without any reason — and they're killing the wounders like this.
There were also two scientists who were just not the audience and saw their own work.
CA: The U.S. security officer Bradley Manning was arrested, and he said that in his interview room, with the video, he admitted to you that 280,000 U.S. citizens have been writing.
Is that true?
JA: We refused to get these books.
Five days ago, 150,000 writing that he had had was arrested after we launched 50 of them.
This year ago, we published public reports from the U.S. government in Kuwait, but they don't have to do that.
I went to that school.
CA: If you were going to get the U.S. diplomatic research?
JA: We published them. (CA: Have you done that.) JA: Yeah. CA: Why? JA: Because of all these projects, the fact that we're doing in the U.S. is showing the human rights position in the U.S. in terms of what's really happening in the world.
If you open hidden data, there's this kind of data.
CA: And I'm talking about it a little bit about it.
In particular, what kind of ideology do you rely on?
So what do you think about the publication of hidden data?
JA: There's a question like this that what information is necessary for the world, what information can lead to.
In fact, there's a lot of information.
It's a sense of what new and good news is going to be about the emergence of those data that governments use to hide, and the institutions that have this information know how to hide the data themselves.
It's always the case. The importance of the mathematician is also dependent on it.
CA: But it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter you, but people can have bad consequences for the whole society.
JA: That's not the case that we're sending out of data.
So we have a policy to protect the causes.
There's some other information that we're going to communicate with each other and then publish it.
Also, there's a disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease.
CA: I mean, they all know their work well.
"If someone who works in the U.S., his son, came to you and said, ""You know that you're going to show you what someone wants to spread with anything?"" This is a video."
People in the U.S. show that they're laughing before they're.
It shows millions of people in this world that Americans don't have human parts. It doesn't really happen.
"My son isn't like that. How are you doing this kind of action?"" What are you going to answer?"
JA: That's actually a lot of money.
But remember that people in Baghdad, Iraq, Afghanistan don't need to see this video; they see it every day.
They don't change their minds. They don't change their minds, their parts.
It's how they see and how they're seeing every day.
But it's going to change the value of people who pay money for that. That's what we want.
CA: So you don't have to find a way to explain the secret secrets of government and companies.
It's good to celebrate.
But what's interesting is that you have to hide your own resources to make your eyes light.
JA: It's not all right. There's no way to go back to WikiLeaks.
Or we don't have any information about the laws.
If there are some, and most of them, it may be difficult for us. We're trying to do so much that people who work with us are trying to help us continue their work rather than losing us.
CA: Well, it's interesting to me because of what I've heard as recently — what do TEDsters think about this?
There are two kinds of ideas about WikiLeaks and Julian.
One is — it's a wonderful thing that makes my relationship clear.
It's a dangerous search for digital.
Who thinks it's amazing?
What's a dangerous search for?
JA: Well, there must be a couple of people, if you don't.
CA: These were my refugee people, Julian.
We have to work a little bit more. Let's show you another example.
It's not yet published at this time, but it's going to be published at TED.
It's an interesting fact that's going on very recently, right?
What is this question?
JA: That's one of the things we see every day.
In the last year — in November — in Albania, there were fluctuations like the Gulf of Mexico, even if it wasn't as strong as the Gulf.
So we've got this machine report that actually the crowdsourcing was done by the way the companies share the cargo cars that their customers put on.
The government of the Philippines and others have been here.
The scientific report didn't have any impact on them. It was a little difficult question.
We didn't know exactly who wrote and what it was about.
And we've noticed a little bit that it could be a game of a global economic company.
"So we went to the research, and we wrote the answer like this, ""We're a little worried."
We don't even know what to do.
"It's good for you. It looks right, but we can't control it."" We've answered a couple of years ago from the company who was trying to figure out the data and writing this story — (Laughter) And it was written like this, ""We want to figure out the data code."" So we said, ""Don't give you a little information."
So what kind of information do you talk about?
Why is it relevant to you in terms of nature?
"Are you really?"" They said, ""Well, they've sent a picture of the software owner on the screen with Microsoft Word ID."
That's how it was.
(Applause) That's actually a lot of thing.
One of the ways to define the science of the software is one of the methods that tries to write a book.
CA: Do you have some information about BP?
JA: Yeah, so many, but now we're working on funding for the news, and the engineers are coming out of the world.
For the last few months, we've reduced the data that we've been present because we've tried to reconstruct the core of the network in order to protect our future public interests.
It's a little problem.
We're going to have the challenges that we're going to raise from one another, such as the institutions that start in the next generation, and we don't have enough employees to understand and explain all of these data, even if we're going to add a lot of information.
CA: I mean, what's going to do you for the most educated students and students who need?
JA: Yeah. People we're going to believe.
It's also hard to develop the data that we have in our own way in a slightly different way, and we need people who are able to deal with high and high-scale health care already.
CA: Can you tell you why we started this?
I think I can't read that you're not changing 37 schools when you're a kid.
Is that data true?
JA: My parents were in film business, and I'm not going to leave religious institutions, and it's the result of them.
(Laughter) CA: Psychologists thought that was paranoid like me.
JA: Are you going to show you film business?
(Laughter) (Applause) CA: Because I know, when I was young, I didn't have xaker, but I had a problem with artists.
JA: I was just a journalist.
I was one of the young activists.
When I was young, I was arrested for a film that I was interviewing.
You have to act a little bit useful with the hackers.
It's possible to do different things with the course of gravity.
Unfortunately, most of the Indian hackers are interested in making money on the bank account of what's going on for Russian cars.
The market of cars didn't look like before.
CA: Well, I don't think what would you do with someone's money. What are the benefits?
Can you give you a little bit of information about them, or can you talk about why they make them, or about events?
JA: I think it's not a real thing.
But my fundamental implications: I think poor and poor people don't make injuries; they help victims.
And that's what I learned from people like my father and grandmothers.
CA: The poor, the poor doesn't make human damage; does he care of them?
JA: I'm a very poor person, I'm completely afraid of them, I don't show them what they're doing, but I'm afraid of the damage that they're doing in the middle of the conversation.
And that's what I've been doing for a long time.
CA: Can you talk about what's going on in Iceland for the last few minutes?
And because of the fact that you published there, the bank had a problem, and the news agency that had the data was sent to the government.
In fact, the news came up.
You've created a good image in Iceland. What happened then?
JA: That was a big deal.
It was a global challenge in Iceland.
It was one of the largest insects in the world.
The total income in the bank sector was 10 times more than any other sector.
We published this information in July of the next year.
"In fact, five years before it was published on TV, and it was given to the TV. In the movies, we've got five of the news about the public recognition. It started before, and the photographer didn't know what to do, "No. What did we do?""
We published the news on the Internet on the Internet, and we were very excited about Iceland, but we went to the morning and talked about the question.
In society, everyone believed that this would happen again, and as we met a few Icelandic institutions and international experts, there was a new law program that was going to be a prosecutor of justice to the government of Iceland, which is one of the most important laws in the world to protect scientists, including the Nobel Prize Prize for liberation.
As Iceland and Norway knew, other skandinavia countries could be involved in the system.
And just a month ago, this law was secretly adopted in the Islamic Parliament.
CA: That's how.
(Applause) Thank you, Julian.
How do you believe that it's going to be? What if you're going to do with the Big Bang, it's going to protect everything secretly, or what else is it going to happen?
JA: I'm not sure what's going to happen.
All over the world — from the U.S., from China to the U.S., there's an increase in terms of corruption and corruption around the world.
It's hard to see what the future will be.
The time that we live is very interesting. We can change everything in a very cool way.
CA: I want our audience to feel what they want to do, Julian, be good, be strong with you.
JA: Thank you very much, Chris. (CA: Thank you.) (Applause)
I'm a writer.
It's my job to tell the story and write the novel, and I want to talk to you a little bit about the story today, and I'm going to talk a little bit about what's called ants.
But before I start this, let me tell you a little bit about your own story.
So I'm going to use words, and I'm going to use words, and you're going to find a few things when you listen to my voice.
I was born in a German family in France.
A little bit later, my audience disappears, and I went to the same village as I did.
Since that time, I grew up as a kid in the honor of a single mother.
In the 1970s, there was a bit of gravity in Antarctica.
Most of the families in our village were large families of the father's family, and I grew up with my mother who was only lost in the patriarchal environment.
In fact, I grew up based on two-class women.
On the one hand, she was a young, global, global, European Turk girl — my mother.
On the other hand, I've always been concerned about what was more religious, less arbitrary, less rational.
Now, I look at the wall of the dragonflies in the black hole, and the devil had a different way to make his eye clear.
People who were lost in their hands, who were lost in their hands, went to visit what.
Every time I've got a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a bit of a bit
And then one of the dragonflies came out of space.
A week later, they were going to a disease-free museum.
I know that it might be amazing to talk about such a science fiction and a scientist, but I couldn't see that there were no other people who were going to help or not have access to what was going to do.
I asked me how he did. That was the power of the voice?
"He said, ""Well, there's the power of the gods, but the power of the fundamental things."" There's a lot of important lessons that I've learned from him, if you want to leave anything in life, if you want to be humiliated, or the soul of the human, you need to go through the walls of life."
It's going to be built inside.
We're all in front of social and social issues.
We're all inside it.
We're all born in a different family, in a different family, in a different way.
But if we can't interact with the world that we're different from yesterday, we're confronted with the risk of getting inside when we're distant.
We can reduce our capacity. Our product gets crushed. We can lose our sense of humanity when we're long in the environment that we're living.
If our friends, our friends, our colleagues, our family are involved, and if we read so much, it means that we are focused on ourselves alone.
Now, women like mine do something like this, they cover the surface of intelligence with lots of pieces, or they turn the surface of intelligence into a wall.
It comes from the belief that's necessary. It's not easy for a person to look at his own image for a very long time.
But even though, living in some of the dreams that share reading ideas is one of the greatest challenges of our world.
And it starts everywhere, between liberals and the monarchs, the agnostic and the believers, the beings and the poor, the world and the world.
We're building groups based on fluctuations and fluctuations, and we're making stereotypes about others.
In my mind, writing can be a key way to transcend these cultural gates.
Even if stories can't distribute the structure, they can also jump in the backgrounds of my mind.
And by looking at these things, because of other worlds, we can also love what we see.
When I was eight, I started writing stories.
One day, I gave my company a little bit of color, and he told me that I would have a good idea to write my stories here.
Now, I think it was a little bit scared by thinking at that time.
It was good to share my stories with my family at home, but it wasn't good to talk to my fellow friends.
I was a kid who was so busy and introvert to talk about beautiful sticks, and I wanted to be afraid of the things that I had touched, and my mother thought that I had a good idea to write my daily passions.
But he didn't know that I thought my life was really scary, and what I wanted to do was to write about this unintended life.
Instead, I started writing not about myself, but about things that are not about others.
That's how I started writing that would turn to my love of immortality.
Now, writing for me was more of others' lives, stories for others than the autobiographical manifest.
Thank you a little bit about these events that started in my life, which I'm not going to go up and explain.
There's another thing that happened on this stage.
My mother became a diplomat.
And I also went out of this small, ambitious, middle-class environment, and I went to a global school environment in Greece, and I was the only student in college.
"The first time I went to the hard environment I mentioned here as ""specific outside."" There were kids from all the nations, but it was an institution for the evolutionary democracy that was not the cosmopolis or the school."
In fact, in this museum, children were recognized as having brought their own self, not their own older women.
We looked like the U.S., and it was great, but it wasn't bad for anyone to do a bad thing for the people, or to talk about religion.
So the kid was surrounded by infectious disease, and it was always tried.
And I remember that when I arrived at this school, there was a military movement in the U.S., and the U.S. armed Papan was trying to kill, and in the U.S. music music music, the U.S. was collecting zero cars.
(Laughter) Sometimes, I went out of high school and started a conversation about being a teacher.
For the first time in this school, I saw a political stereotype.
"And all the kids asked me about ""Midnight Express."" They asked me how many dragonflies I had taken over the day, so they brought them all kinds of dragonflies. They asked me how old I was starting to cover my head."
I've learned three strereotypes related to the government here, these are: education, cigarette and headline.
After Spain, we went to Jordan, Germany, and then to Antarctica.
And I thought my imagination and my imagination were a gift box that I was going to be able to save with myself, all of these events.
Stories gave me a sense of coherence, of continuity and of persuasion — I was not aware of these particles in real life.
When I was 20 years old, I went to the city of Istanbul, which I loved so much.
I lived in a very cosmopolistic and living environment, and I wrote a piece of my novel here.
I was there when I was in Istanbul in 1999.
On the 3th of the morning, when I was out of the building, the street that I saw was standing on me.
There was a famous, old seller, who didn't sell alcohol in his store, who didn't talk to other men and people who lived in traditional life.
He was sitting in front of a long-dimensional, long-dimensional telescope, which was spreading into his eye.
And I also saw that the ship came out of the cube with the dragonflies of the cube, and that's the other thing that I think about that night — the transsekual that's crying with the seller is going to dragonflies around the road.
When we're confronted with death and climbs, our global changes go away, and we're all going to be one for a few hours.
But I've always believed that stories have a remarkable effect.
I don't want to say that science is as powerful as a genius, but when we look at a good novel, we're getting away from our own little comfortable room, and we're starting to know people that we haven't ever met in the dark of the night, and we haven't had a good idea of anything.
And just after that incident, I went to the college of girls in Boston, then in Michigan.
It's not only geological, but it's a completely different way of looking at language.
I started writing in English.
It's fascinating, it's amazing. They ask everyone why I'm not writing in English, and it helps me change my writing language.
I love writing in Arabic, and what I write is more poetic and emotional, and I love writing in English, and I think it's more mathematical and intuitive.
I think I'm connected differently to every language.
As millions of people around the world, I've learned English later. English is a language of later learning.
So when you learn a language later, you have to lose what you're learning as well.
As language comes later, we want to talk more, to work better words, to make better conversations. We talk less about it, because there's a huge difference between our brains and our language.
That's interesting.
But if you learn not to worry about it, it can stimulate us.
And that's what I learned in Boston — it's a mountain and an elephant stimulus that I lived.
In those moments, because of all my actions — I'm looking at what I've been following with a growing anxiety, I've also brought me home to their everyday prayers, and I'm going to be able to put together just after that moment, after that.
I created a life of life because God loved what he loved.
(Laughter) But I went to Arizona instead of deciding.
And because my wife was in Istanbul, I started to go and walk between Arizona Istanbul, and I couldn't feel so much in the other two parts of the world.
I'm always talking about some of my parts, physical and spiritual.
It's like my stories are always with me to keep all my interests and parts out there.
And I think he's losing his hand when he's more effective than the story.
And I'd like to think about it as well as you.
One of the lessons I wrote in English is that one of the social teachers in America, because of light, did this.
"And he said, ""I love the book."" He said, "Well, you would write a little different.""
(Laughter) So I asked me what to do.
"He said, ""Let's show you all that there are many Spanish, American, Spanish friends, but there's only Turkey that he's a person."" And he's actually standing at the University camp in Boston. It's normal for me to have more people than other nations, but I don't understand what the teacher wants to do."
But I know that I'm going to continue to make it fun.
He wanted me to be my own manifest.
He wanted to be a woman in the book because I was a woman.
We're actually talking about changing the world of stories, but we can also see that politics has helped spread, read and understand stories.
Most of the writers, especially those who don't know about it, are getting out of that picture.
If you're a woman from the Islamic world like me, they're waiting for you to write about the Islamic woman, it's better that this religious woman isn't happy.
They're waiting for you to write more interesting, sad, typical stories, get away from the gravity of gravity.
When I was a kid, I had some of my regrets in Spain in India in the world's economy.
writers look not like creative people who have their own ideas, but as a representative of institutions and countries, a few writers from China, a few from Nigeria.
They're waiting for us not to do anything, but to apply to our education.
In 1984, when he took his interview from a writer and a writer James Balw, they asked him a few times about justice.
"And when I took the Internet, when I tried to make it valuable as a blue writer, Billwin stood up, and he said, ""You don't see I have anything else, and I have nothing else, and it's exactly what I have."" When politics tags us, it's under the threat of our freedom."
There's a very, very, very unprecedented context that all the writers who don't have heard of, which is called a great society.
About 10 years ago, I remember the first great reading at Harvard University.
We were three writers, one from the Philippines, one from the country, one from Indonesia to the lobby.
(Laughter) But we didn't have any education or education that brought us together.
It was just our passports.
They're waiting for writers from another country to write real stories.
It's actually a function for creativity.
In this way, not only writers, but their artists become more mass players.
And I've got to realize that this kind of approach to story doesn't exist in the universe.
That's what happens around the world.
And I saw it for the first time in 2005, when I was brought to justice because of what was happening in the past century.
And I've tried to write a very, very, very, very interesting story about women's eyes and about women's family.
When I applied to the law, my little story became a big macro problem.
Because I wrote about the Turk-Americans law, some of them thank me, some of them.
But I'd like to tell both of them at the time that it's just about science.
It's just a story.
"I don't want to reduce the importance of what I see when I say, ""Just story."
I love and support science not because of how it's being dealt with, but because of how it's happening.
The writers are recognized by the black view, but the political books are enough today, but the language of society is not the language of politics today.
"Then Shakespeare says, ""The proper way to make things work and the proper way to do things is all different concepts."
"And it's the job of the artist to make the second."" The politics separates us from each other. The science unites us."
One is based on the extra dimensions.
It's a digital scanning effect.
One makes sense.
The digital doesn't know what's happening.
The politics has been completely corrupt.
It's from water to water.
"There were people who would say a science story called ""unclear."" They would go to the mosquitos, and they would say stories very often before the mosquitos."
They changed the questions to show the different images in the story, and they blew them.
They all went to listen to him, good people, even men, women, extraordinary men.
"People crossed the rules. Central Asia, South Africa, Balkans and Asia, like ""The Nature of Milky Way.""
Now, stories continue to cross the rules.
Palestinian and Israeli scientists don't listen to each other when they talk to them, but a Palestinian writer, a Palestinian writer, is teaching a Palestinian writer's work, and it's communicating with the way of storytelling.
In fact, science has to bring us closer.
If it doesn't look at it, it's not good.
Books help me — for some time, a kid who was embarrassed and embarrassed.
But there's also a challenge to budget books.
After the writer and the lawyer Rumi met his spiritual wife with Snems River, the first job of Shakespeare was to take the books of his wife into the water and listen to what was written in it.
"So, as a chef said, ""The knowledge that can't get you away from you is more than ignorance than ignorance."" The problem of social gates today is not lack of injustice or lack of knowledge. We think we know a lot about each other, we think we know more precisely. We don't get rid of the knowledge that we see ourselves, we're elite, we're away from others, and we're leaving our society."
There's a picture that I love: live like the way the ship works.
One of the reasons for science is that it's stable.
And the other thing is that it's all about me, and it's all about me.
And that's how my work is.
Part of the work that I wrote is going to go to the city of Istanbul, and the other part is moving around the world, interacting with different institutions.
So I believe that my work is both local and universal, and it's true to us everywhere.
You're the people who are traveling to Istanbul and you're pretty sure you're seeing the House of Camps, and it's about 1400 years ago that the U.S. citizens have been governed.
There's a place that's already called the Women'sview site in the house from anyone's room.
This is the place between the buildings.
I love this approach.
We don't believe in places that are between us.
We calculate the destruction of fuzzy-like creatures, which are made of unstable environment, which is the symbol of dissonance.
And my idea is that the public students who are in the middle have to be in front of them.
I'm giving you the advantage of compassion and generosity that I write.
I love to think about 10 years later.
I love my friends to inspire me.
In one of my stories, I can talk about a woman, and there's a very, very good woman, and I can be a famous blue professor from Norway, who's the greatest of my work.
We can talk about everything until it comes from us.
"Aido Lorde says, ""Our good fathers say, ""I think I can do it."" He said, ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry."" It was a very good example for me."
And I don't realize that, because when we're still learning writing, we're telling students about what you know.
Maybe it's not good for the beginning.
Creator doesn't depend on who we are, what we know and how we belong to self.
We have to learn to write about what we're feeling with the wisdom and each other with a very specific product.
We have to get away from the global gates, we have to recognize other worlds.
So, draw all the lines, like the dragonflies that go into the universe.
Because they're not dependent on the political situation, they're putting together all of their bodies, and that's the good news.
"I'd like to end my journey with a big challenge, and I'd like to say, ""Let's meet, be friends, let's put things on the road; love; the world is the great world."" Thank you very much."
(Applause)
My big idea is a little idea that will reveal a big idea with millions of hidden ideas inside us.
I'm going to have this little idea.
(Laughter) (Applause) Here are the women who belong to the group A. There are still none of them.
They're women.
And I had a very hard deal with the importance of it.
Two years and a half ago, I lost my mind from tiredness.
My head was in the room, my face was in the middle, and my right eye was hit five points.
Now, I started to understand the importance of it.
In that period, I talked to teachers and teachers, so I can tell him that the only way to be better, to be happy is to sleep normal.
(Applause) We're going to start with women in this environment.
We're going to be the most alive in the word.
(Laughter) (Applause) Because it's so amazing that little sleepers are considered ignitic.
Now, when he was familiar with someone recently, he started to talk about what he was sleeping four hours a week ago.
"And I went out of my mind and I said, ""Well, I didn't say — ""You know."
"If you were five hours, would the Indian nets be more interesting?"" (Laughter) Most people sleep less."
"And if you're here in Washington, and somebody wants to come to dinner and say, ""What's the eighth hour?"" And it's probably eight night, but there's nothing, I'm going to play a little tennis, and I'm going to talk to you for a few places."" And they think they're very successful, and they're not going to say it, because there's a lot of leadership that's going to make a lot of bad decisions in politics and politics."
It's going to have the rise.
It's not going to be a good leader, it's going to be a good leader before it hits Titanic.
It's a lot of asteroids that can make our Titanics.
I think Lehman Brothers, if they were Lehman Brothers, they would be happy.
(Applause) When the girls were seven days and 24 hours, seven hours and a half or eight hours ago, they would see Arabic, and maybe they could figure out what's going to happen.
In a period of time that we're confronted with lots of things, everything that's useful for ourselves, that's good for our lives, that's best for the world, not depending on where we live.
And I'm also convinced that you can remove the eyes, the devices of the window, to see the power of the big ideas in the world.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I was like a kid who had a girl.
If you see the brain, you can see that the brain is made of two-dimensional galaxies.
Thank you very soon. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.
Now, the information that's going on in energy is now spreading across all the sensory systems shows how the moment looks like, how it looks like, how it looks like, how it looks like, and how it feels.
We're an energy that's connected to the energy around our right brains.
On that point, we are perfect, full and invisible.
The left brain is completely different.
The left half is a methodic idea.
And our left brain thinks in language anyway.
The only thing I could do was the extra energy — power.
"And I said to myself, ""Why do you see me?"
I feel the surface in my mind. Thank you.
