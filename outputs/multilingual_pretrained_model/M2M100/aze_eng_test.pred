And today I will speak to those who do not wait.
I’m working on solar technology.
And I have a little bit of mind, and I have a little bit of mind, and I have a little bit of mind, and I have a little bit of mind.
And then look at the shadows.
This is just a small video of what we do.
Oh... a little bit.
It can be loaded for a while.
(Smile) We only—pass this feeling—I will pass over the feeling that is video only... (Smile)
The Smile (The Smile)
It’s not that... (smile)
It is good. ( laughing )
The solar technology.
My time is over?
Good, thank you very much.
and the
I do not want you to do what you do.
We will return to it after a few minutes. I hope that if you learn to take care of your body even a little, it will change your life significantly.
We speak the tongue, and we speak the tongue, and we speak the tongue, and we speak the tongue.
The highest places interest us: (Smile) is just something like unrighteousness or laughter, unimportant sight or disturbing observation, or even hand-touching.
Thus they approach the house of ten numbers.
The fate of the President of the United States.
We are shut down, we are shut down.
We are.
We are trying to be unseen for the man near us.
As you see, the animals and humans do the same things.
He is strong and strong, and he is strong and strong.
And when it comes to us, we will be able to do the things of others.
So if anyone puts power against us, we try to accumulate, and we do not expose his gestures.
Instead, we will follow his power.
And I saw that many of them were in the midst, and they were in the midst.
They are among them, and they are among them, and they are among them, and they are among them, and they are among them, and they are among them, and they are among them, and they are among them, and they are among them, and they are among them.
There are only two kinds of people who are in the shadow of the shadow.
And they put their hands in this way.
I have made a few things for me.
First of all, you will not be repented.
It is believed that it depends on this.
The women are more likely to follow this law than the men.
The women are more weak than the men, and this is not surprising.
And this is very important for them, for they have the value of their work in their degree.
Those who are worshipped, are worshipped, and they are worshipped.
The men and the women who are in the same way, and who are in the same way, and who are in the same way, and who are in the same way, and who are in the same way, and who are in the same way.
I began to think of myself, so that those who come into sinfulness are more active.
And if we want them to do this, will they be more active?
And if we do, do we have the power to do, and do we have the power to do, and do we have the power to do?
Now we know that our gestures and mimics determine the thoughts and feelings of others about us. This has a lot of subjects.
But this is what we do, and what we do, and what we do, and what we do, and what we do, and what we do.
This is true in both cases.
and the power of the power.
When we feel strong and secure, we tend to the gestures that show more strength, but when we try to be strong, we also feel strong.
What do I say when I think of the power?
I talk about thoughts and feelings, as well as about the physiological things that form them, and for me these hormones. I learn hormones.
What is the power of the wicked and the power of the wicked?
Those who are in the position of impotence are only 60 percent; this is a sufficient significant difference.
This is what we have seen in testosterone.
Those who have gone through the test of strength from the moment they came to have a 20% increase in testosterone and a 10% decrease in others.
Thus, the two changes will be made.
Those who are in the cortex are:
Those who are in the strength position have a 25% decrease in cortisol, while others have a 15% increase.
The two-minute punishment leads to these harmonic changes, our brain feels more ambitious, secure and comfortable, or stressful and closed.
These feelings are known to us all, right?
Thus, our body language determines how we do not think about ourselves and how we feel, that is, the other words are not only for others.
We change our minds, but we change our minds.
We are the one who can change our lives, and we are the one who can change our lives, and we are the one who can change our lives.
This is a two-minute experiment in the laboratory.
And where is the real life?
And this is the one who gives us the power.
We believe that this is the way that the people of the world will be able to do what they do, and they will be able to do what they do.
Where shall we be rewarded?
This is the table behind the new foods.
This is for some of them.
For some of them, it is an oath, or it is an oath, or it is an oath.
We thought that many of you would be interested in this, because many of you would be like this.
Thus we gave up our prayers, and the media discussed them widely, and this was what the judges said: "Do we have to do so when we go to the business?"
We have indeed disbelieved; no, we have not seen it.
It is unlikely for you to do so.
This is not with your others.
It is for you.
What do you do before you start?
You can watch on your iPhone or Android.
You look at your signs, you swallow, you gather yourself, but this is what you must do, as you sit on the way of standing.
That was what we wanted.
The associates came to the laboratory, and after regaining the strength and weakness poses, they passed through a very hard job.
The five-minute video was recorded.
Those who evaluate the Mussahibah were taught not to use them by means of non-verbal to get the opposite of the influence; they appeared like this.
Five of them are better than five of them, and five of them are better than five of them.
No one likes it.
Marian LaFrance calls it “Stop in Social Conflict” which increases the level of cortisol in the person.
So We passed them from a complaint to see their findings.
And then we showed them four of them.
They were unknown of what we were waiting for.
They were unknown who got the poses. After watching the videos, they showed the people who got the high power poses, saying, “We want to take them to work.”
“We don’t want to take them to work.
“And those who were before are more good,” he said, “What is the effect of this?”
This is not because of them.
It depends on what they do.
And we have seen the other signs of them, and how good are the signs of them?
What are the advantages?
There were no indicators.
That was not what was revealed.
But the people only showed their truth.
And they made their own worship.
They did not think of them, but they did not think of them.
This is the result of the fact.
And when I say to people that our bodies can change our thought, our thought behavior, and our behavior can change our outcomes, they say, "Is this not a little bit?"
I will tell you until the truth is reached.
“I am not that.”
I don’t want to do anything, I don’t want to do anything.
I don’t want to be a liar.
“I do not want to be in a place where I am not.”
"I deal with these words very well. I want to talk to you a little story about the feeling of being sad and 'Bura is not my place'."
When I was 19 years old, I had a heavy car crash.
The car was thrown into the desert.
I have been twisted several times on the earth.
I went to the rehab of the headaches of the headaches, and I had to leave the colleague, and I kept aware that IQ has fallen down by two indicators. This was very painful for me.
I was a child, I was a child, I was a child, I was a child, I was a child.
I tried to go back because I was removed from college.
They said to me, “You will not be able to finish the column.
“There are many things that you will know, but the collective is not yours,” they said, “I began to say with it that your basic characteristic that you possess was this cry for me, and nothing can weaken you as it is taken from your hands.
I felt very weak.
I have worked, I have worked, I have worked, I have worked, I have worked.
I finished the column.
“I had to spend more than four years of time with my group colleagues, and Susan Fiskeni, my teacher, agreed to accept me to Prinston University, so I fell to ‘where I’m not helping.’”
I was sad.
20 Thou shalt hear, thou shalt hear, thou shalt hear, thou shalt hear.
It was the night before.
I was so afraid that the morning would be opened, that I shocked my master and said, “I will not be able to do it,” he said to me, “No, you will do, I have come to the mercy in your midst.”
He will be, and you will do what I say.
Even if it is Saxony.
You will do all the things you have to do.
And if you fear and fear, and your body does not listen to you, then it has been taken, and if you fear and fear, then your body does not listen to you, and if you fear and fear, then your body does not listen to you.
“You will work until you say, ‘It’s coming from my hand.’” I’ve done so.
Five years ago, I read the high pillar of the Quran. A few years ago, I was in Northwestern, I was in Harvard, I worked there. Now I don’t think about it, but for a long time I thought, “Bura is not my place.”
At the end of the first year I was at Harvard, I didn’t talk once in the course of the semester, and I came to my cabinet quickly, saying, “You should participate in the class or you’ll be cut off.” I didn’t know him well.
And when he came into him, he said, “This is not my place.”
This was a return for me.
He has done two things.
First of all, I realized that I would not be able to do that.
But he felt, and those feelings were known to me.
The second, I realized that he was in the right place.
And he knew what he had done, and what he had done.
And I said to him, “Good, it is your fullness!
From the morning he will show himself as belonging to the bur, he will show himself strong, and he will go into the shelter and give the best shelter given as today."I said, so he did. The shelter remained mat, so they didn't know he was sitting here. (Smile) A few months later he came to me and I saw him imitating his shelter, not until he felt the truth, until he realized it.
He was changed.
I would like to say to you,
Imitate until it becomes real.
Do it until you are the one you want to be.
I want you to know,
They can make a great change.
So I said two times before that.
The two, the two, the two, the two, the two, and the two.
Try to do this for 2 minutes before a situation that you will be assessed once, in the elevator, in the hammer room, behind the table, or behind the attached door.
Do what you want.
Make your brains better than your brains.
Increase your testosterone and reduce your cortisol.
“Afsus, I couldn’t show them what I was able to do.”
“I know who I am to them and show them who I am.”
I wish that you do not share it with others, for this is very simple.
This is not a matter of itself. (Smile) Publish what you learn and share with people, because people who will be able to benefit from it are people who do not possess technology and resources, nor status and power.
Share it with them, so that they may take advantage of it.
Those who are in the midst of their life are the two who are in the midst of their life, and those who are in the midst of their life are the two who are in the midst.
I thank you.
and the runs.
We have a lot of people in the world.
And the worst among their superpowers is the invisible.
Those who are the worshippers are those who are the worshippers who are the worshippers who are the worshippers.
The Catholics are engaged in a hard, honest and necessary work that benefits everyone, but they are not grateful for it.
Here, in Brazil, 90% of the products that will be re-emalled are they gather.
And many of them are in the midst, and they are in the midst, and they are in the midst, and they are in the midst.
Carroches are cars made of taxt or metal that can be found in some of the Brazilian minorities and remind them of graphity or small art.
And this is the reason for me to get to know these superheroes.
I am the righteous and the righteous; I am the righteous and the righteous; I am the righteous and the righteous; I am the righteous and the righteous.
In the year 2007 I went to the town, and I went to the town, and I went to the town, and I went to the town, and I went to the town and I went to the town.
And this time, I had to bring them to the shadows.
I had a lot of trouble, and I had a lot of trouble, I had a lot of trouble, I had a lot of trouble, I had a lot of trouble, I had a lot of trouble.
Today they are small, and they are small, and they are small.
I know that this is the world, and I know that this is the world, and that this is the world.
In many cities I painted more than 200 carros, and in the world I was invited to many exhibitions and tourists.
I found out that the catadores with their invisibility do not belong only to Brazil.
I found them in Argentina, Chile, South Africa, Turkey, and even in developing cities like Yaponia and the United States.
And I realized that there was a greater number of people in the world, and that it was a great thing.
"After that I created a movement under the title 'Be My Carroça' (Pimp My Carroça) - a movement that knows how to finance from the people."
I thank you.
and the
He was a great man, and he was a great man, and he was a great man, and he was a great man, and he was a great man, and he was a great man.
The catadores were grouped by doctors, stomatologists, pediatricians, hair stylists, massage therapists and well-known professionals and health care providers.
And when the roofs were cleansed by our countryside, they were given equals to see the roofs of security, the roofs of rainless plaque and the city.
And they took other means for uncertainty: exhaustive lenses, signs and goods.
Thus, they are the little ones, the little ones, the little ones, the little ones, the little ones, the little ones.
"Let My Carroche Be Beautiful" came out to the little ones in Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Kuribita."
“With the inspiration of TEDx to meet the demands of the cities outside of Brazil, we created the Pimpx, which is a simplified, funded by the people, free prepared version of the ‘Being Beautiful’.”
And all of them will know.
"In the course of 2 years, 170 catadores, 800 countryside and 200 small messengers, and more than 1,000 donors joined the movement "Be Beautiful" with their help, even in the indigenous scribes the emal was taught again."
Thus, when the people were in the midst of the wrath, the people were in the midst of the wrath, and the people were in the midst of the wrath.
They know what they do, and what they do, and what they do, and what they do, and what they do, and what they do.
And I call you to find the cathedrals in your city and other invisible superheroes and to know them.
Look at the world, and see it, and see it, and see it, and see it.
Whether you believe or not, there are more than 20 million catadores in the world.
And when you see one who comes therefore, know them as a part of our life.
Very orbigado, thank you.

Before Nosair was known for sinless from the castle, but while punishing by light castles with other crime partners, they prepared attacks plans to a series of abides of New York: tunnels, canyons and the headquarters of the United Nations.
The plannings were rejected by the FTB staff.
But it was unfortunate that, in 1993, the World Trade Center was not able to deal with the bombardment.
He was known to be the one who was the one who was the one who was the one.
He is my Father.
In 1983, in Pennsylvania, Pittsburgh, I looked at the world as the son of his - Egyptian engineer and famous American, ibtidai scientist. They didn't tell me what came from their hands to live a happy childhood.
After the seven years of age, our family has changed relationships.
My father saw me, and he saw me, and he saw me, and he saw me, and he saw me, and he saw me, and he saw me.
And I learned these things from my life experience: after people know each other enough, it does not take a long time to realize that in fact each of us has the same expectations from life.
Every religion, every nation, and every nation, and every nation, and every nation, and every nation, and every nation, and every nation, and every nation, and every nation, and every nation, and every nation, and every nation, and every nation, and every nation, and every nation, and every nation, and every nation, and every nation, and every nation, and every nation, and every nation, and every nation, and every nation, and every nation.
A few months before his imprisonment, my father stood in front of me and told me the last few weeks with his friends that they went to police shooting exercises on the island of London.
And I said that I will go with him in the morning.
We arrived at the Kalverton Shooting Police, and then we didn’t know that it was in the FTB’s secret custody.
And when my father came to me, he helped me to keep my gun in my neck, and he dealt with how I had a thirty-metre nickname.
On that day the last rose I threw came to the small narrow lamp on the niche, and the niche resulted in it. Everyone was surprised by it, especially I.
And he turned to the other men and said, “Ibn Abuh” from Arabic, “It is the ball of his father.”
All of them laughed, but after a few years I realized what they really laughed.
And they thought that my father had seen me, and that they had seen me.
Those people were known to have caused the deaths of 6 people and the injuries of more than 1,000 people when the furgon filled with almost 700 kg of decomposing material of the World Trade Center's Shimal Gulf will stand underground.
I have made these people to me.
“Ammu” was the people I called Ammu.
As I was 19 years old, we changed our place of life twenty times and this change that lasted throughout my childhood caused my friends to be less.
And whoever is near to me, and whoever is near to me, and whoever is near to me, and whoever is near to me.
And I had a child, and I had a child, and I had a child, and I had a child.
I would keep my identity hidden from my sinfish companions in order not to be in the center of the dictatorship, but it became so clear that it was sufficient that the new shagirdin of the sinfish was the most poor and the top.
So I’ve spent a lot of my time reading books at home, watching television or playing games.
So there were conflicts in my social unity backs, and I was not prepared for the truth of life as a great fanatic family.
And I have made the people, and I have made the people, and I have made the people, and I have made the people.
What did I open my eyes?
This is the first time I have come to the world, and I have come to the world, and I have come to the world, and I have come to the world, and I have come to the world, and I have come to the world.
I had the opportunity to participate in the National Youth Convention held in Philadelphia in the framework of the preparation program.
And I was a child, and I was a child; and I was a child; and I was a child; and I was a child; and I was a child; and I was a child; and I was a child; and I was a child; and I was a child.
And the people of our covenant were the people of our covenant.
I learned that one of the children I was friends in the last days of the convention was a Jew.
This fact was only revealed in a few days, but I came to the difference that there was no enemy between us when we wanted.
I had not been a Jewish friend before, and I was proud to say the right, and I was so proud to know the barrier that believed that I was not defended throughout my life.
And I have a lot of trouble, and I have a lot of trouble, and I have a lot of trouble, and I have a lot of trouble, and I have a lot of trouble, and I have a lot of trouble.
I was in the midst of the people who believed, and I was in the midst of the people who believed, and I was in the midst of the people who believed, and I was in the midst of the people who believed.
I have been taught a great portion of my life that homosexuality is a sin and that all the gays in society have a beneficial effect.
The work came so that I had the opportunity to work with gay artists in one of the tables, while many of them were the best people I saw as indian and the least inclined to punishment.
I revealed that it is a sense for me to form a feeling like burning life to the punishments of others as a person who is very narrow in childhood, and to make another a righteous that I do not want against myself is a sense for me to remember.
And I was able to do this, and I was able to do that, and I was able to do that, and I was able to do that, and I was able to do that, and I was able to do that, and I was able to do that.
I don’t know how to be gay, but I know very well how to be punished because of the reasons that are not hanging from you.
Con Stuart promised me to be honest with myself about my fanaticity and helped me realize that the human, religious and gender orientation is not related to the enjoyment of his sexuality.”
And my father said to me that I was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one.
“The inspiration comes from an unpredictable place many times and the fact that the Jewish comedian has shown a more positive impact on my world view than the extremist father has not come to me.
One day, my mother and I talked about the change of my world view, and my mother told me a word that I will not get out of my heart for a lifetime.
My mother looked at me with a tired eye as a person who lived enough dogmatism throughout her life and said, “I was tired of hating people.”
And I knew that he had no power, and that he had no power, and that he had no power.
Abraham is not my true name.
I changed my name, and I changed my name, and I changed my name, and I changed my name.
And why did I give up, and give up?
It is easy when it comes.
This, I hope that maybe someone who has a tendency to violence will hear my story and get to the difference that there is a more correct way. I was not fanatic despite being confronted with violence, non-tolerant ideology.
I have made my life, and I have made my life, and I have made my life, and I have made my life, and I have made my life.
I call this the victims of terror and their afflictions, the terrible suffering and the struggle that terrorism has brought to them.
And I will not be able to do this, but I will not be able to do that, and I will not be able to do that, and I will not be able to do that, and I will not be able to do that, and I will not be able to do that, and I will not be able to do that.
As a simple example of what I advise, I am a living insight that violence has not passed through religion and religion and that the son is not in the power to go by the path of the father.
I am not my father.
I will thank each one of you, and thank you, and I will thank you.
Good morning!
Unreliable?
They took the name written sign on them, but I wanted to ask you, who wrote the name on his sign in Arabic?
Who has written? no? good, no problem.
A few days ago, I sat in a restaurant with my friend and ordered meals.
“I looked at the office and said, ‘Do you have a menu?’”
And he looked at me when he heard the word.
“He said, ‘Take forgiveness?’” I said, ‘Menu (in Arabic), if it had no harshness.’” He replied, ‘What are they saying to him unknown?’” “I know.””
“He said, ‘No, it’s called ‘menu’ (English) or ‘menu’ (French).
“Come, come and go with it!” said the officer.
"He was astonished to talk to me, and he said to himself, 'If she had the last girl in this world, I't look at her.'"
What does it mean to say “Menu” in Arabic?
And the two of them were the children of God, and the children of God were the children of God, and the children of God were the children of God.
How did he speak this?
At that moment I began to think.
And this has made me shameful.
This is the truth of the man.
They do not accept me because I speak in their own language.
And where can it be elsewhere?
How did we fall?
But when we are here, there are many people here like me who reach such a mercy in their lives that they take their hands out of everything that has happened to them in the past to know that they are mercy and city.
Do I have to forget all my township, my thoughts, my cry and my memories?
And the best of them are the best of us, and the best of them are the best of us.
I have learned in Arabic, and I have learned in Arabic.
Do I forget to be one of them?
Would it be here?
And when I looked at it, I tried to take it up.
I didn’t want him to judge me with what he had judged me.
The Arabic is not the language of the day.
It is not the language of knowledge, the language of research. Or it is not the language we trust to present the broad research project we are used to in the workplace we are accustomed to in our universities. And it is not the language we use in our airport.
And if we had done so, they would have wiped out our clothes.
Do I have to speak my tongue, and do I have to speak my tongue?
Do you want us to use the Arabic language?
This is a reality.
But there is another reality that we have to think of.
Arabic is the main language.
You will be able to know the language of your mother, and you will be able to know the language of your mother, and you will be able to know the language of your mother.
The language of the creator is the language of the creator, and the language of the creator is the language of the creator.
How to?
The first time the Arabic was written, the first time the Arabic was written, the first time the Arabic was written.
And all his thoughts, and all his philosophies, and all his sons, and all his sons, and all his sons, and all his sons, and all his sons, and all his sons, and all his sons, and all his sons, and all his sons, and all his sons.
So, when he began to write in the English language, he had enough base.
And when you read the scriptures in the English language, you will know that it is, and you will know that it is, and you will know that it is.
And you know that He is the Son of the Mountains, which is written in the English language.
This is an example of which no one will argue.
Second, it is said that if you want to kill a nation, the only way not to kill a nation is to kill its language.
This is the truth of the punishment of the wicked.
The Germans, the French, the Cayons, the Chinese - these nations are in the difference of this rule.
Thus they shall protect their tongues.
And they are blessed.
Thus they use the language to produce, and they pay a lot of money to develop the language.
Do we know more of them?
We do not want to be good in the world, we do not want to be good in the world, we do not want to be good in the world, we do not want to be good in the world.
Those who were like us, but for the development of research, and those who stand up with those cities, Turkey, Malaysian, and other cities, when the pillars came out, they brought their languages with themselves, and they kept it as if they did not take it.
And the tongue was near to them.
For if you get a product from Turkey or elsewhere and there is no label on it in the Turkish language, say, it is not a domestic product.
You would not believe that he is a native.
They would be the buyers like the previous, the unpleasant buyers like we were in the past.
Thus they had to protect their tongues to renew and produce.
“If I say, ‘Azzadness, sovereignty, independence’ (in Arabic) what will this remind you?”
What do you remember, right?
Who, how and why.
The tongue is not the word, but the word is the word, and the word is not the word.
It is the language of our life, and it is the language of our life, and it is the language of our life.
"So, when we say, 'Azzadness, sovereignty, independence', each of you has special forms in his minds, in the special period, there are special feelings in the special day."
The language is not one, two or three words or letters.
It is the present idea that relates how we think, how we see each other, how others see us.
What is intelligence?
How do you know that this man is a man?
"So if I say, 'Azzadness, sovereignty, independence' or if your son comes and says, 'Father, do you live in the time of freedom?'"
What is unpleasant?
If you don’t see the problem, it’s best that I go out and don’t speak in the empty place.
This is the reason that these words remind us of a particular thing.
I have a French friend who is married to me.
One day I asked him, “What do you do?”
“He said, ‘Everything is good, but one day I tried to translate the word ‘toqborni’ for her all night.’” (Smile) The wicked woman said to her ‘toqborni’ and then tried to explain the word to her all night.”
And he said to him, “How can man be so hard?”
Does he want to commit suicide?
“What do you say to me? (in English) This is one of a few examples.”
We began to think that the woman cannot say that word to her because her husband will not fall into account. And she is true in not falling into account. Her thinking is different.
"My friend said to me, 'He is listening to Fairuza with me and one night I tried to translate for him so that he may also feel what I felt when I listened to Fairuza.'" The sad woman tried to translate it for him, 'I stretched my hands from them and grew you.'" (Smile) And that's the problem: 'And because you belong to them, I took my hands back and left you.'" (Smile)
Give me this for you.
What did We do to protect the Arabic language?
We have made it to the subject of the citizen’s punishment, and we have begun a campaign to protect the Arabic.
“But many people said to me, ‘Why are you narrated?’
And forgot it, and forgot it, and forgot it, and forgot it, and forgot it, and forgot it, and forgot it.
He said, “I speak with you from the east, and you answer me from the east.”
"We didn't say, 'No, we don't accept this or it.'" We didn't choose this way, because they didn't deal with us in this way."
And whoever speaks to me in this way, I hate the Arabic.
We say, We want to change our own reality and in the way that we expose our desires, our desires, and our daily life.
We are the ones who are like us, and the ones who are like us.
He said, “I speak with you from the east, but you answer me from the east.”
It is very simple, at the same time, creative and believing.
After that we started another campaign written letters on the ground.
“Would you see this example in the shadow, and it is written, ‘Do not kill your tongue!’ on the letter covered with black and yellow lens?
Do not kill your tongue.
We do not have to kill our tongue.
If we had to kill our tongue, we would have to find our identity.
We would have had our worship.
We would be back when we started.
This is a great way for us, and for us, and for us, and for us.
After that we spread the Arabic letters of the shaped sons and daughters.
“Cool” for girls and boys.
“We’re very “cool”!”
“And whoever says, ‘Aha, you have spoken in English!’” I say, ‘No, I have not accepted the word ‘cool.’” Let them do as much as they disbelieve, but give me a better promise that the reality may be better expressed.”
“I’m going to continue saying ‘internet’. I don’t say ‘I’m going to the world’s grandson.” (smile) Because this is not worth it. We should not deceive ourselves.”
But when it comes to this point, we must believe that if the example speaks, we should not allow the greater or those who think they have an influence over us to manage us or to show us what they want and feel.
It is a creative idea.
If we do not know the flight or the flight or the flight or the flight or the flight or the flight or the flight or the flight or the flight or the flight or the flight or the flight or the flight or the flight or the flight or the flight.
Every one of you is a creator.
Your language is a way of creation.
Let’s start from this moment.
Let us write a novel or make a short film.
It is a roman that can bring us back.
The Arabic is the language of the Qur’an, and the Qur’an is the language of the Qur’an.
“It is not right to say, ‘There is no way of exit,’ there is a way of exit.”
But we cannot and must believe that there is a way of exit and that is our debt to be a part of the way of exit.
What do you know today?
Who tweeted?
If my time is saved, I am very much of you, whether in Arabic, English, French or Chinese.
Do not write in the Arabic language, and do not write in the Arabic language.
This is a disaster, this is not a language.
You will enter the virtual world with the virtual language.
There is no return from that place.
This is the first thing we can do.
And there are many other things that we can do.
Today we have not come together to believe each other.
We are here, and we are here, and we are here, and we are here, and we are here, and we are here, and we are here.
And I will give you a shrimp.
He knows his father for the first time.
I will not say to her in English, "This is your dad, honey."And I promise to my daughter Nura that in the supermarket she says to me in Arabic, "Thank you very much."I will not say to her, "Thank you very much, Maman," and I will not hope that no one has heard her."
Come and save us from this town.
I learned a few things from doing these 30 day exam.
I had a month of time every day, and I had a month of time.
30 days before I start the exam.
He is very bad.
Indeed, they are very wicked.
and the
As I read the book well, my expectations were high. I began a fast life full of happiness with the feeling of joy, the accumulation and the happiness of the way.
I fear, I fear, I fear, I fear, I fear, I fear, I fear, I fear, I fear.
“When I began the lesson, I heard a sudden painful voice when I left the room, as I did before, as I was shaken, as I was shaken, as I was shaken, as I was shaken, as I was shaken, as I was shaken.”
There was no one on my side, but the light and the accuracy of the shrine I heard was surely.
“He opened the door,” I heard.
It was a start, the voice came.
And the first days, and the next weeks, I had all things to do with me, and the third person had spoken to me.
“He is in the midst.”
The voice was neutral, sick and even after a period of time called to his friend and hopeful. Also I thought that this sick voice exhibited the emotions that I did not exaggerate when.
And when I came to him, when I came to him, when I came to him, when I came to him, when I came to him, when I came to him, when I came to him, when I came to him, when I came to him.
And they said to me, “I am not a man, I am not a man, I am not a man, I am not a man, I am not a man.”
I am a columnist.
I had to help him, and I had to help him, and I had to help him, and I had to help him.
“For me, I have been working as an apparatus of the campus news in a quick television and I have been working as an apparatus of the school news and I have been working as an apparatus of the night and I have been working as an apparatus of the night and I have been working as an apparatus of the night and I have been working as an apparatus of the night.”
Then he began to go out of my eyes.
I was sick, then a diagnosis of schizophrenia was placed, then the worst: a punitive disappointment, disappointment and disappointment related to myself and my future came.
I have heard the voice that I have heard, and I have heard the voice that I have heard, and I have heard the voice that I have heard, and I have heard the voice that I have heard.
This was a kind of psychiatric battle, which resulted in the number of voices increasing and more hostile and angry crying.
Do you see the water in it?
In the end, a period of fear, escape, impotence and disagreement was created. I was not able to create peace and peace in this battle that I felt powerless.
Two years later, I began to get worse.
And I was in possession of all the chastises of the female: horrifying voices, acaib images, strange, untouched countings.
And when I see the disappearance and disappointment of those years, I think that a man is dead and a man is saved.
He was sent to the way, and he was able to go out of the way, and he was able to go back to the way, and he was able to go back to the way, and he was able to go back to the way.
Many people have hurt me throughout my life, and they are all in my memory, but these memories have been very weak and weak compared to those who have helped me.
I think Eleanor is going to do that.
He said, “If there is a bit of rain, then it will surely come after it,” and he said, “It is not enough for me to thank those beautiful people who have been blessed with me and for me in the 14th minute, and who are saved from the thin and disturbed land and waiting for me to return.”
Indeed, it was difficult for me to believe it from the earliest voices to the enemy and the adulter who came, and therefore the first major step was not to learn to know what I counted the truth before.
For example, I learned to explain the voices that are going to attack my house - not as a real and objective danger, but as a feeling of fear and danger.
I believed in them.
And in the night I sat down at the door of my parents, and put them in mind, to protect them from the voices that I have considered true.
He said, “Do not work with me.”
“You don’t see I’ve got a plastic tape?” I said, “This is my strategy.”
And when I came to know this, I came back to the psychiatrist, and I came back to the psychiatrist, and I came back to the psychiatrist, and I came back to the psychiatrist.
Now I am proud to be a member of Intervoice, the Organizational Part of the International Voice Assembly. Prof. Marius Romme and Dr. Sandra Escher's work, this discourse takes the coming voices as a life strategy, evidence as a mind-to-mind approach, abnormality, not as a sign of schizophrenia, becomes a difficult, important and valuable state that is required to be taught.
This is the punishment, and this is the punishment.
He said that if he had changed, he would not be able to return.
There is no humiliation to humiliate man.
There is no fear for those who do not fear.
In the last 20 years, the Hinduism of the Voice has not spread to 5 cities and 26 cities. Working together, we extend the possibilities of people with illness, compassion and spiritual difficulties, we become hopeful and practicing. On the basis of our success, we stand up to the human potential.
As Peter Levin said, it is a unique being that has an intellectual spirit to use this body that has the instinct of human provision.
From this point of view, the greatest honor for our community is to help someone who needs to provide, to be with, to stretch his hand, to share his punishment and to give hope to provide.
We are unlike, we are not rewarded.
We do not have anything to do or do not have anything to do or do not have anything to do.
There is no light.
“As a good man once said to me, ‘Don’t talk about what others say about you.’”
He said, “Thank you.”

I am here to talk about my photography.
Is this a picture?
It is not a picture that you can take with your camera.
My first photo began when I was 15 years old.
This I joined with my marriage to the previous righteousness, but in a little different way, because when using the camera, I planned a type of process in advance.
When you take a photo with the camera, the core button of the camera is ready when it is pressed.
I did not have the right time, but I did not have the right time.
I thought that everyone could do it.
So I wanted to create a distinct thing, a thing that was formed after it was formed.
This is the way of the wicked, the way of the wicked, the way of the wicked.
It is an unexpected game.
And he is near to the truth.
Or those who are in the dark, and those who are in the dark, and those who are in the dark, and those who are in the dark, and those who are in the dark, and those who are in the dark.
I look at realism, I look at realism.
I wish that these are not the forms that we will be able to draw, but the forms that are possible to be drawn by a camera.
I would like you to have a little bit of it for you.
And this is the best thing to do, the best thing to do, the best thing to do, the best thing to do.
And what is the good thing for him, and what is the good thing for him?
Is it with them or with them?
Is it a light?
What is the creation of illusion?
It is the vision of the creator.
And how does the world come, and how does the world come, and how does the world come, and how does the world come?
This is not what the reality really is, but what those who seem real to us really are.
And when it comes to a thought, it is a thought.
I see it in the creation of the truth that I have created, and in the creation of the truth that I have created, and in the creation of the truth that I have created.
And I will give you an explanation.
There are three kinds of things in the world, and there are three kinds of things in the world, and there are three kinds of things in the world, and there are three kinds of things in the world.
But when it comes to a certain form, it looks like a three-dimensional object that is present again.
And we know that it is not possible.
We do not know what the brain is, but we do not know what the brain is, and we do not know what the brain is.
And I see when I see the scenes of the scenes.
This is the fact that the truth is the truth.
The truth is the truth, the truth is the truth, the truth is the truth, the truth is the truth, the truth is the truth, the truth is the truth, the truth is the truth, the truth is the truth, the truth is the truth.
And when they see it, they see it; and when they see it, they see it; and when they see it, they see it; and when they see it, they see it, they see it.
“There are three kinds of things that I want to say, which we have to do to obtain a true result.
As you can see, there is no one who has the right to do so.
But when it is united, such a thing is taken.
First of all, the sights are the sights, the sights are the sights.
The second, the lighting of the combined photographs must be the same.
And in these two ways, these two shades are expected - the same height and the same light.
The third is the one who gives righteousness, the one who gives righteousness, the one who gives righteousness, the one who gives righteousness, the one who gives righteousness.
He is the one who does not know how he is created.
Therefore, we will be able to do this in order to ensure that you have the ability to do so in order to ensure that you have the ability to do so in order to ensure that you have the ability to do so in order to ensure that you have the ability to do so in order to ensure that you have the ability to do so in order to ensure that you have the ability to do so in order to ensure that you have the ability to do so in order to ensure that you have the ability to do so in order to ensure that you have the ability to do so.
This is another form.
People can think that this is a place of righteousness and that the altered part is downward.
In fact, this image came in full, with the shapes of the different places.
It is easier to create a place than to find a place, in this way you do not need to change your ideas even if they are small.
But this is a great plan.
And I knew that this idea came to my network in the winter, and that it was a few months for me to find different places that will complete the pieces of the temptation as a plan and model.
Thus, the fish is the fish of the wicked.
The shores are the shores of the shores.
Thus, the water is shed in a stone.
And I even painted the house on the island to look more swedish.
The truth is the truth, the truth is the truth, the truth is the truth, the truth is the truth.
It always begins with a thought.
Then they come to the shape of the shape.
Every one of them is a good one, and every one is a good one.
And if you make the pictures good, it can be as good as the result is and as realistic as it is.
There are all the things we need, and the only thing that destroys us is our power.
I thank you.

Chris Anderson: Julian, welcome to you.
It has been revealed that Wikileaks has published more information than all the world’s media has published in the past years.
Is that possible?
Julian Assange: Yes, is it possible?
Is this not a disappointment for the so bad work of the remaining world media? A small group of activists is able to disclose more information than the entire world media.
Q: How do you do this?
How do people do this?
How do you protect the principle?
“These are those who do know what we do, and those who do know what we do, and those who do know what we do, and those who do know what we do.”
We are calling upon the people of the world, and we are calling upon the people of the world, and we are calling upon the people of the world, and we are calling upon the people of the world, and we are calling upon the people of the world.
The information is accepted in encryption or adjacent manner, the information is viewed as it is in the adjacent agencies, it formats—when it is a little difficult information base—this can be explained to the legality and we protect ourselves against possible legal and political attacks.
He said, “There are many things that you do not know, and there are many things that you do not know, and there are many things that you do not know.”
We know the truth, we know the truth, we know the truth, we know the truth, we know the truth, we know the truth, we know the truth, we know the truth.

[Smile] CA: I was CIA, TED asks the code of membership. (smile)
and the sight of the sight of the sight.
This is the one which has been revealed before it.
This is the sight of you.
It was a story from Kenya.
How do you know how you are speaking?
This is Kroll Report.
After the 2004 election, it was an investigation carried out by the Kenya government.
until the election of 2004, Kenya was governed by Daniel Arab Moi for 18 years.
He was a dictator in Kenya.
And when they came to the power of the coalition and came to the power of Kibabi and begun to blaspheme with corruption, they spent two million pounds in this same account.
Thus, the people of Moses, who were in the midst of Moses, and in the midst of Moses, who were in the midst of Moses, and in the midst of Moses, who were in the midst of Moses.
It is the Holy Book of Kenya Journalism.
[28] [28] [28] [28] [28] [28] [28] [28] [28] [28] [28] [28] [28] [28] [28] [28] [28] [28] [28] [28] [28] [28] [28] [28] [28] [28] [28] [28] [28]
We published this account 3 days after the new president Kibabi Daniel began to approach the man who will put his hands on the moines of the Arab Moine. After this incident, the account was lost to the president Kibabi.
CA: The short word – the account has not been linked to the Kenya text, so it has been transmitted by ways. And you think it has changed the result of these elections.
JA: Yes. The news was first published on the main page of the Guardians, then in the cities around Kenya, in Tanzania and Canubi Africa.
It came from the news.
In the day of the resurrection, he began to write a book of the Qur’an.
[20] In the day of the resurrection, [20] [20] [20] [20] [20] [20] [20] [20] [20] [20] [20] [20] [20] [20] [20] [20] [20] [20] [20] [20] [20] [20] [20] [20] [20] [20] [20] [20] [20] [20] [20] [20] [20] [20] [20] [20] [20] [20] [20] [20] [20] [20] [20] [20] [20]
Q: Is it that you have changed your life, and you have changed your life?
Yes yes.
And this is the light of the light, and the light of the light is the light of the light.
The video essence is a little long. This short clip is in the form.
As I said before, there is a little violence in this video.
Radio:... ZIBIL, if it is opened.
They appear, they appear, they appear, they appear, they appear, they appear.
It is light, fire.
And when you see them all, you will see them all.
Shoot them all.
Fire and Fire.
(Fire from automatic weapon) Dham, continue. (Fire from automatic weapon) Dham.
Hotels: Bushmaster Two-Six, Bushmaster Two-Six,
I have to go back, I have to go.
We killed eight people.
There are two vertiolots, and we need to go to fire.
They were all dead.
Two-Six, Two-Six is speaking, moving.
Oops. forgive me. what was it?
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahah
Q: How did this video work?
And it was hard for the people to do it.
Two people were sent to Baghdad to investigate this video.
This is actually one of the three attacks in the video.
Q: Do you know that there are two people who have been killed in this attack?
A: Yes. Two Reuters workers were killed, two children were injured.
18 to 26 people were killed.
The publication of these verses has caused a widespread disturbance.
What was the cause of this anger and anger?
I don’t know what the people have seen, but they have seen what the people have seen.
Thirty-thirds of people, who are in the midst of the earth, are in the midst of the earth, and they are in the midst of the earth, and they are in the midst of the earth.
There were two writers who did not know what they did, and who did not know what they did.
CA: U.S. security agent Bradley Manning has been arrested. It is also that 280,000 U.S. survivors, along with the video in the questionnaire room, have also confessed that they have flown messages to you.
Is that true?
Yes, we disbelieved that we received these writings.
5 days ago, he was imprisoned after flushing 50 of the 150,000 letters he owned.
We did not give them the gift, but they did not give them the gift, they did not give them the gift, they did not give them the gift.
And I made it to me.
And if you were a Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him)?
“And we would have revealed them; and yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.
And if they do, they will be the secrets of these things.
We have a little to talk about this.
Which ideology do you rely on?
What do you think about the revelation of the secrets?
It is a matter of what information is necessary for the world, and what information can cause recovery.
In fact, there is a lot of information.
It is a sign that the revelation of the news they do to hide the economic power of the organizations is new and good; the organizations that possess these information know also how they do not hide the information.
This is the case in practice; the time of the journalism also depends on it.
CA: But it is not a little dangerous, when it is a disappearance, people, not hanging from you, can even be a bad result for all the punishment.
And that is not what we have made, but what we have made.
We shall be protected from harm.
Those who have the knowledge of the Qur’an, and those who have the knowledge of the Qur’an, and those who have the knowledge of the Qur’an, and those who have the knowledge of the Qur’an.
And there are the law surrings — such as the sick's surrings with the law, such surrings are protected by the law. But we do with the news carriers who know what they do.
Everyone knows what they do.
“If a son who serves in the U.S. army approaches you and says, ‘Do you know that you have published what you want to spread for any purpose?
The American army shows that people laugh when they die.
It shows millions of people in this world that the American army has no human feelings.
“My son, what do you do with this movement?”
Yes, that is a lot of things.
But keep in mind that people in Baghdad, Iraq, Afghanistan do not need to see this video; they see it every day.
They do not change their minds, they do not change their minds, they do not change their minds.
Every day they see them.
Those who have changed their minds will change their minds, and this is what we want.
He said, “You do not find a way to illuminate the secrets of the government and the company.
Lighting is better.
But this is the wonder that you have to hide your own minds in order to illuminate the sirs.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Or we do not have any other things to do.
If they were such and many, it may be difficult for us. We do so that the people who do business with us try to help us to continue their business rather than to damage us.
He said, “What do I hear, what do I hear, what do I hear?
There are two kinds of opinions about WikiLeaks and Julian.
He is the one who gives light to them.
Those who are worshipped.
Who thinks that he is wicked?
Who is the righteous?
Yes, it is good, but it is not enough for a few people.
CA: This was my own people, Julian.
We have to work a little more, we have to show another example.
It will not be revealed, but it will be revealed.
Is this a real thing that is close to you?
What is it for you?
This is one example of what we see every day.
In the end of the year – in November – there were breaks like in the Gulf of Mexico, although not as strong as in the Gulf.
We have made a complaint of such an engineer that, in fact, the breakdown of the Lord's corporations is the way of the breakdown of the burden machines placed by the guardians.
And the people of Albania and others were there.
And the account of the engineer did not have anything to do with them, but you were a little difficult.
We do not know who it is and what it is.
We have a little doubt that the Lord is the Lord, and the Lord is the Lord.
So let us look at you, and let us answer, "We are a little doubtful."
We do not know what we do.
"You are good, it seems right, but we don't know how to confirm.""We answered from the company that just a week ago tried to find the meaning of the information and wrote this text—"We want to find the meaning of the information.""We answered, "Give a little bit of information."
What do you say in all things?
Are you the one who is the one who is the one?
"Do you really?"" They sent the Lord of your owner with Microsoft Word ID deleted on the screen as a response."
So he saved.
That is a lot of things.
It is one of the ways in which the Qur’an is written, and one of the ways in which the Qur’an is written.
Q: Do you have any information about BP?
“No, but we do so, and we do so, and we do so, and we do so, and we do so, and we do so.”
We have been able to do this in the last few months, and we have been able to do this in the last few months, and we have been able to do this in the last few months, and we have been able to do this in the last few months.
This is a little problem.

Q: Do you have the right to work with the basics and/or the journalists?
Yes, and people that we believe.
It is more difficult for us to develop the information that is in our hands because it is obtained by a little different way. We need people who will be able to cope with the highest level of security and the highest level of security.
Q: Do you know how it begins?
[37] And he said unto them, Thou shalt say unto them, Thou shalt say unto them, Thou shalt say unto them, Thou shalt say unto them.
Is this true?
“My parents were in the film business, and I fled from the religious ceremony, and the result was both.

And many of them, who are in the midst of the covenant, are in the midst of the covenant, and many of them are in the midst of the covenant.
The sale is not the same as the previous.
“I don’t think you’re going to be the one who’s going to be the one who’s going to be the one who’s going to be the one who’s going to be the one who’s going to be the one.
Can you give them a brief information about them, or can you speak about the cause of which they were created or about the events?
He said, “Whoever does not do it, does not do it.”
But my basic values are: I do not create victims, but help victims.
This is what I have learned from the people of my Father and my Father.
He is the one who creates, and he is the one who creates; he is the one who creates.
JA: I am a little righteous man, I am completely protecting them, and I don't show the fool. But therefore I protect the victims by revealing people from committing a crime.
That’s what I’ve had for a long time.
Q: Do you know what is happening in the last few minutes?
Then you came to him, and he came to him, and he came to him, and he came to him, and he came to him, and he came to him, and he came to him.
And the Qur’an was revealed.
You created a good imic in Iceland, then what happened?
And that was a great thing.
It was in Iceland.
He was one of the greatest in the world.
Thus, the worship of the worship of the worship of the worship of the worship of the worship of the worship of the worship of the worship of the worship of the worship.

"The money was given to the government five minutes before it was published on television. As in the films, the government order execution began five minutes before the news and the author didn't know what to do, "There's never been such a situation. What was it?"
We had to be able to do what we did, and we had to be able to do what we did, and we had to be able to do what we did, and we had to be able to do what we did, and we had to be able to do what we did.
Everyone in the punishment was sure that this will not deal again. As a result, after meeting some Icelandic politicians and international experts, a new law was presented to the Iceland government that will be the protector of the jurists, this law is one of the most basic laws that serve to protect journalists in the world, matching the Nobel Prize for freedom of speech.
Iceland and Norway will be able to enter the system of other Scandinavian countries.
And a month before this law was secretly adopted in the parliament of Iceland.

I am the one, Julian.
How do you believe that the future will come? will the Great Brother secretly watch everything, or will people watch the Great Brother watch, or will it be a different kind?
I am not sure how it will be.
In all the world, and in all the world, and in all the world, and in all the world, and in all the world, and in all the world, and in all the world.
It is difficult to see how it will come.
It is a very difficult time for us to live, and we can change everything in a very difficult way.
He said, “I will hear you, and I will hear you, and I will hear you, and I will hear you.”
A: Thank you very much, Chris. (CA: Thank you very much.)
I am a writer.
It is my job to tell a story and to write a novel. Today I want to talk a little about you about writing a story, and I will talk a little about the beings called gins.
But let them give permission before they begin, I will tell them a short story.
“I will use the words as a Tabi, and you will find a number of things when you listen to My Nick.
I was born in a Turkish family in Strasbourg, France.
Then I came to the house, and I came to the house, and I came to the house, and I came to the house.
And I was in the midst of the midst of the midst of the midst of the midst.
In the 1970s, there was a little bit of an uncertainty.
Many of the families in our countryside were large families where the father was the head of the family. I grew up with my mother, a single divorced woman in the Patriarchal context.
I had two women, and I had two women.

He had an old, old seller, who did not sell drinks in his store, did not consult with the wicked men and living the marginal life.
He had a long black pair in his eyes, sitting next to the transsequal spread on his face.
