So today I'm going to talk about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology industry.
And so that's my little beginning, to empower myself and push myself through this challenge and do this.
We looked at different sources for this.
So this is just a little video of what we've done.
Ha — wait a minute.
The increases can save some time.
(Laughter) We're just going to — I just want to play one animated excerpt from — I'll just jump right out of the video here, just — (Laughter)
Nope. (Laughter) (Laughter)
(Music) That's not... (Laughter)
Okay. (Laughter)
Solar technology...
Oh, my time is up.
Okay. Thank you very much.
(Applause)
So I want you to notice what you're doing right now.
I'll come back to that in a few minutes, and I hope that learning to exercise even a little bit more control can change your life in such a profound way.
We are very interested in body language, especially when other people's body language gets our attention.
What unlocks our eyes is: (Laughter) what is unfolding, or smiles, or eyes that are blank or eyes that are distressed, or even things that tie us together in a very simple way.
Man: This is them approaching the number 10.
This lucky policeman applies his hand to the President of the United States.
We jump in. We save ourselves.
We're kidding.
We're trying to be invisible to this man in our Qaris.
So, you can see now that, nonetheless, animals and humans are doing exactly the same thing.
When you confront something that's powerful and weak, a consensus emerges.
When we have power of speech, we tend to emulate the gestures of others.
That is, if someone uses force on us, we tend to accumulate. We don't counteract their gestures.
On the contrary, we rely on its strength.
I've seen MBA students exhibit a huge amount of power dynamics.
And some of them are aparıring as leaders, and they're entering the classroom, and they're sitting there in the middle of the room, and they're not even starting class.
As they go around, they're replacing almost two people.
qaldır their hands.
So, I've come up with a few solutions for myself.
The first will probably never bring you down.
So, if you've got one, it's related to this gender.
So women are more indebted to the law than men.
Women tend to feel weaker than men, and that's not surprising.
And this is very important for MBA students, because it affects the way they study.
Business schools are always fighting against gender difference.
The men and women who are at the same level are getting different grades at the end of the course, and it seems to be a correlation.
And I started to realize to myself, this is actually how people are becoming more active in education.
So if we show them these videos, and we ask them to take it outside and show it to themselves, will they become more engaged in the learning?
So can we stand and be strong in the face of a change in our behavior and therefore be stronger in that change?
We know now that our gestures and mimicry determine how others think and feel about us, and there's a lot of evidence for that.
But the real question that we're interested in is whether these gestures and mimicry can still work on us.
So it happens in both cases.
Also in the question of strength.
We tend to be driven by desires to be stronger and more secure, but when we try to be stronger, we feel stronger.
In terms of emotion, what do I mean by thinking?
I'm talking about the ideas and feelings, the physiological things that make them up, and to me, these are the hormones. I study hormones.
What is it about people with disabilities that makes them think differently?
But only 60 percent are underrepresented. That's impressively significant.
This is what we found in testosterone.
From here outwards, those who had a lot of stress experience saw a 20 percent increase in testosterone, whereas the others had a 10 percent increase.
In just two minutes, you can make these changes.
And here's what happened in isolation.
Those in the background had a 25 percent increase in their cortisol, and the others had a 15 percent increase.
And it's only in two minutes that you have these mental changes that make your brain feel more robust, more confident and more relaxed, or less stressed and more alert.
Well, those feelings are familiar to all of us, right?
So our body language also determines how we think and how we feel about ourselves, so that non-verbals are not just for other people.
But it also changes the way we think about our bodies.
And so the next question we ask, the next question we ask ourselves, is whether just giving ourselves a few minutes of extra power can change our lives in such a profound way.
This is a two-minute experiment that took place in the lab.
But where do you implement that in the real world?
So this is, of course, the thing that is of interest to us the most.
And from our fiction, those pozas can be used to honestly address socially dangerous situations.
And where are we honest usually?
In fact, that's the kind of cafeteria table in the back for inquiries.
For some people, it's just school meetings.
For some, it's a elan, or this is how you give a talk, or it's a job interview.
It seemed like the idea a lot of you were interested in meaningful business interviews because that's where you're most experienced.
So we published our findings, the media debated them, and this is what the cybercriminals were saying: "" So we're going to do this when we're going to do business interviews?
(Laughter) Of course, we disagreed. No, of course we didn't! We didn't mean to.
It makes no sense to do that.
This is not about the rest of you.
It's the way you communicate with yourself.
What do you do before you start a mission?
You're sitting there. You're looking on your iPhone or Android.
So, you're looking at it, you're kneeling down, you're sitting there, but basically what you've got to do is, basically, this is what it looks like when you're sitting on your feet. It's like sitting on your feet for two minutes.
That's what we wanted to get away from.
So the contractors came to Laboratory Laboratories and they went through a tense business interview after they had re-examined the bonds of power and weakness.
This was a five-minute interview recorded.
And honest people — and I was telling them that honest people weren't supposed to use any kind of non-verbal medium to deflect their influence, and that's what they looked like.
Looking at our emotions in five minutes is more like asking questions.
Nobody likes that.
Marian LaFrance calls this "" staying in social shoes. "" It raises the level of cortisol in people.
We interviewed them like this to see what they were doing.
And then we showed the coders four of these shots.
They were unaware of our government and our expectations.
And they were unaware of which of the uncensored images they were getting, and as they watched the video, they said, "We want to get this to work," and they were showing these high-powered images.
"" We don't want to take them to work.
The previous ones were more positive. "" Well what impact has that had?
It's not because they said something.
It's because they're doing things that are degrading their behavior.
We looked at other metrics like their performance, like, how accurate are their speeches?
What kind of advantages do they have?
It made no difference whatsoever to them.
So that really wasn't the main thing that happened.
People only show their true faces.
So, they're exhibiting themselves.
They showed no sign of efficacy at all, in fact, on their own.
What does that do to success?
And when I tell people that our bodies can change our minds, and our minds can change our behavior, and our behavior can change our outcomes, they say, "" Isn't that a bit counterintuitive? "" And I go, "" Yeah.
I'm saying try to imitate until you get to the truth.
"" Not even I am.
I don't want to feel like I'm standing in the middle of something to be realized.
I don't want to be a victim.
"I don't want to be in a place that isn't fit for me."
"I understand those words very well. I'd like to tell you a little story about being sidelined and feeling like this is not my place."
When I was 19, I got in a very heavy car accident.
You've been driven out of your car.
And I was recited there several times.
I woke up in the physical rehabilitation unit for my finger injuries, had to leave school, and I was told that my I.Q. had dropped by two points, which was very painful for me.
I got an I.Q. because I was known as a smart, talented kid when I was a kid.
I walked out of college, and I tried to come back.
They told me, "" You'll never be able to forget college.
There's more that you can do, but this is not your college. "" I began to contend with that there was nothing that could weaken you, like the fact that you had this fundamental trait, which I thought was very wise, to take out of your own hands.
I felt completely vulnerable.
I worked, I worked, I worked on my own foundation, and eventually, I was successful.
So as a result, I ended up in a college.
I had to take four years more than my four companions, and I convinced my advisor, Susan Fiskeni, to admit me to Princeton University, which is where I decided I was not going to be.
I was a Saxon.
I gave a first-ever 20-minute lecture in Princeton that 20 people listened to.
It was the previous night.
I was so afraid that the morning was going to open, I called my headmaster and said, "" I can't know. "" He said to me, "" Well, you know, I've just come to your village.
So it's going to stay, and you're going to do what I said.
Saxta, yeah.
You will give all the talks you have to do.
And again, once again, when you're scared and you're freaked out, even though your body doesn't hear you, 'Well, it worked. I finally did it!
You're going to work as hard as you can say, 'He really did.' "" So I did.
I've been a high school dropout for five years, and I moved to Harvard for a few years, worked there, in Northwesternd, and I don't think about it anymore, but for a long time I thought, "" This is not my place.
At the end of my freshman year at Harvard, a student who I had spoken to once during my semester in class, came to my office and said, "" You have to attend, or you're going to be in jail. "" I didn't know her well.
He goes inside, completely numb, and he says, "This is not my place."
This, to me, was my turning point.
Because two things happened.
The first thing I realized was that I no longer had that feeling.
But he did feel that way, and those feelings were familiar to me.
And the second thing I realized is that it's in the right place.
So he could mimic and do that.
And I said, "" Yes, you are there!
I said in the morning, it'll show itself here, it'll show itself strong, and — (Applause) — it'll go into the classroom and give it the best explanation it's been given to date. "" And he did. The cynics had no idea he was here, he was sitting there. (Laughter) A few months later, he came to me and I saw that he was imitating what he could, not what he felt, but what he actually did.
It had changed.
And I'd like to share with you what that means.
You have to imitate it until it becomes real.
Do it as long as you want to be who you are.
I'd like to share with you what's in my suitcase today.
Changes in language can make a huge difference.
Now — those are the two minutes I just talked about.
Two minutes, two minutes, two minutes.
And the next time you're honest about a situation, two minutes out, try to do that in the elevator, in the hammock room, on the table behind, or behind the closed door.
Just do what you want to do.
You've got to know that your brain is going to be in the best condition ever.
You increase your testosterone. You decrease your cortisol.
Don't let go of me with, "OMG, I can't show them what I do for a living."
Go out of your way to say, "" I am able to communicate and show them who I am.
And I want you to do that, to apply that power to your work and to share it with others, because it's very simple.
This is not for information. (Laughter) Disseminate this stuff and share it with people, because the people who are going to benefit from this are usually people who don't have the technology or the resources or the status or the power.
Share this with them so they can use it personally.
Because their lack of attention to their grandchildren for two minutes in a row can profoundly affect their lives.
So, thank you very much.
(Applause)
We have a lot of misconceptions about the world.
Now, the worst thing about their superpowers is invisibility.
Catastrophes are people who are piling on recyclable materials to make a living.
The cathodes are doing a hard, honest and necessary job that benefited everybody, but they're not thanked for it.
And here, in Brazil, they're picking up 90 percent of the recycled goods.
Most of the blocks work separately. They collect dust from the streets and bring it back to the shopping malls.
They're like cabs and metal cars just found on a few streets in Brazil, and they remind you of graffiti or street art.
And that's what got me introduced to these amazing prisoners.
I'm a graphic artist and an activist, and most of my work revolves around social, political and environmental issues.
In 2007, with the goal of promoting urban life, I translated my work from walls to canvas.
But this time, I was using catalysts.
So speaking, I had to talk more about mixing art and yummy things together, because these things actually brought these cathedrals into focus and helped them to build more self-confidence.
Today, they're popular on streets, in the press and on social media.
And again it's one of the things I've been thinking about all my life since I came across this world.
I painted over 200 posters in many cities, and I was invited to many exhibitions and tours around the world.
And I noticed that because they're invisible, they're not native to Brazil.
I've seen them in Argentina, in Chile, in South Africa, in the world governments, and even in several developing countries like Australia and the U.S.
I later realized that I needed more people getting involved in this subject, because it was a big deal.
And then I created a movement under the title "" My Carrot Makes Me Wonderful "" — (Laughter) — a movement that is funded by the ring.
So, thank you very much.
(Applause)
I mean, the "" Carrots are amazing. "" It was a great movement, a movement that was supported by a ring that was created to help catadors and carrots.
They were supported by doctors, dentists, pediatricians, hairdressers, massage therapists — well-known professionals, and the health services, again.
Also, when wolves were being repaired by our volunteers, they were given security helmets, and they were given wings to see the beautiful beach and the city clearly, without rainfall.
And they also received other gifts for education: anti-depressants, syringes and candles.
And eventually they would be displayed by street artists and would become part of this spectacular, large-scale display.
"My journey has been amazing" Walked the streets of Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Curitiba.
But inspired by TEDx to address the demand of cities outside Brazil, we created Pimpx, which is a simplified, ring-funded, voluntary version of "" It Makes My Country Wonderful. ""
So everybody would be able to join in.
In two years, 170 cathedrals, 800 volunteers and 200 street artists, and more than 1,000 donors joined the "" Make Money Wonderful "" movement and with their help, we've even redesigned many local schools.
We don't put invisible people back there anymore, and the more they are, the more they are valued.
They were able to defy crazy ideas because of their extraordinary generosity, and they were able to increase their income and their visibility in society.
So now I'd like to ask you to spot and recognize the catadors and the other invisible superheroes in your city.
Try to see the world as a whole without boundaries and borders.
And believe it or not, there are more than 20 million of them in the world.
So every time you see one of them, recognize them as part of the life of our community.
Thank you very much, very much.
(Applause)
On November 5th, 1990, a man named Al-Sayyid Nosair went to a chain hotel in Manhattan and he assassinated Ravvin Meir Kahane, the leader of the Jewish medical society.
First, there was no sin from the president that Noah worshipped, but being punished by lightning rods, along with other criminal centers, they were planning offensive plans for a number of New York City wards: tunnels, synagogues and the headquarters of the U.N. military.
Fortunately, the plans were foiled by the FTB authorities.
Unfortunately, in 1993, the World Trade Organization was not able to resist the bombing.
Finally, noah was venerated for his kindness in the Holocaust.
Al-Syyid Nosair is my father.
In 1983, I walked out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to the world as the son of a missionary engineer and a loving American elementary school teacher, and they weren't going away to do anything to make me a happy child.
After seven years of age, things started to change in our family.
My father was forced to see the side of Islam that very few people, including many Muslims, see.
And the lesson that I learned from my life experience is that when people really get to know each other enough, it doesn't take long for them to realize that our expectations from life are the same.
There are few people in every religion, every country that have the awesome delight to add something to their faith and use every means at their disposal to make sure that others carry on with them.
More than a few months ago, my father stood in front of me and told me how he and his friends had gone to teach puppies in London Island over the last few weeks.
He told me to come with him in the morning.
We got to the Kalverton Fire Department. We didn't know at the time that it was under FTB surveillance.
When the magic came to me, my dad helped me keep the gun in my fence and figured out how to target the 30-meter sniper.
The last arrow I fired that day was a contact with a small narcotic lamp on the sniper's bow, which resulted in the sniper being fired. This surprised everyone, especially me.
And his mother turned to the other men, and she said, "Ibn abuh," which means "" Daughter's boy "" in Arabic.
They all laughed at this word, pretty much, but a few years later, I figured out what they were actually laughing at.
They thought they were seeing my father's magic tricks happen on me.
These people were last described as being fascinated when they detonated a furnace, filled with nearly 700 kilograms of explosives, underground in the World Trade Center in the Himalayas, killing six people and wounding over 1,000 others.
These people made me proud.
These were the people I named my mom.
Twenty times, as I was 19, we changed our places of residence, and that change, which occurred in my childhood, caused me to have fewer friends.
Some of them made me feel closer to myself, so we had to move to another city.
And as a newbie in my syllabary, I was often targeted at small children.
I kept my identity secret from my classmates so that I wouldn't be in the middle of attention, but it was pretty clear that the newest kid in the class was the quietest and the best in the class.
As a result, I spent a lot of my time at home reading books, watching television, playing games.
So I had a disability in my social communication skills, a disability that made me not exactly ready for the realities of life as someone who grew up in a super-fanatic family.
I grew up in an environment where people were judged arbitrarily by things like race and religion.
But what opened my eyes?
Speaking of which, I think that I took one of my first experiences to take such a perspective, and I did so during the 2000 presidential elections.
I got a chance to participate in a university education program and a national education program that was performed in Philadelphia.
My generation, when I was growing up, was mainly concerned with youth violence, and I was very unaware of the issue, as someone who was exposed to children's violence on a night out, much of my life.
The members of our group were people who had different lifestyles.
I found out in the last days of the conference that one of the kids I got to know was a Jew.
That fact has been detected just a few days ago, but I've come to realize that there's no natural enmity between any of us.
I had no Jewish friends before, and, quite frankly, I announced this with a feeling of pride because I was once on a stage in my life believing that I was not going to be insulted.
And another milestone was I found some extra money for an amusement park at Busch Gardens in the summer.
I was here with a community of people from many different faiths and cultures, and that experience was central to the evolution of my communication.
Many years ago, I was taught that homosexuality was a sin and that all gays had a negative impact.
And I ended up having the opportunity to work with some of the gay artists in this performance, and many of whom, in the meantime, were by far the wisest and least enthusiastic people I could see.
I discovered that there was a feeling inside me that like a grown-up, it was uncanny to wake up someone's mind, and when I do this, it is unacceptable to me to make a mistake that I did not want to make to others.
Through this mission, I was able to compare the stereotypes I had learned from my childhood with real life experiences.
I don't know what it is to be sad, but I'm very familiar with what it is to be sad, for reasons that I can't tell you.
"" Later that year, it was on "" The Daily Show. "" Con Stuart helped me to be honest with myself about my own religious fanaticism, and he helped me realize that it wasn't about the quality of people's race, religion or sexuality that mattered most.
Con Stuart became a father to me in the very moment that I needed him, literally.
Ilham comes from an unexpected place all the time, and I couldn't help but feel that a Jewish comedian had a greater impact on my worldview than his extremist father.
So one fine day, I had this conversation with my mother about how my worldview had changed, and she said these words that I'll never regret in my lifetime.
My mother looked at me with these tired eyes, like she's been a doomed doomed woman all her life, and she said, "I'm fed up with hating people."
For a moment, I understood just how much negative energy it takes to have that feeling of hatred inside you.
Zak Ebrahim is not my real name.
I changed my family's relationship to my dad so that we could decide to bring everyone into new life.
Now, why did I expose myself and put myself in danger?
And the answer is very simple.
That, I hope, is maybe one day when someone who is anti-Semitic will hear my story and realize that the right way is to go — that I'm not a fanatic, despite being exposed to anti-Semitic ideology.
Instead, I chose to use my life experience as a tool to fight terrorism and fanaticism.
I call it the victims of terror and their loved ones, the terrifying suffering and loss that terrorism has brought them.
And I'll not be bothered by my father's actions when I'm confronted with these kinds of cruel activities, let alone the victims of terrorism.
As a very simple example of how they look at me, I am a living animal, and I am a creature that does not listen and does not gesture, and does not have to go in the way of the spoon.
I'm not like my father.
Thank you very much. (Applause) I'll thank you all. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) I'm grateful. (Applause)
The morning is not good!
Barefoot?
They took the nişan, the one that says my name on it, but I wanted to ask you, did anybody here write their name on it in Arabic?
Kafka? Nobody? Okay, no problem.
So, I was sitting in a restaurant with a friend the other day, and I had an order for food.
I looked out of my office and I said, "You have a menu?"
And he looked at me really awkward, thinking he'd heard that word wrong.
He said, "" Please? (In English) "" I said, "" Please. "" He said, "" You don't know what they're saying to him? "" "I know."
He said, "" No! It's called'menu' or'menu.'" "Am I right about my French alphabet?"
He said, ""əl, come on over and do it! "" The office guy said.
"He used to get irritated to talk to me, and he used to say to himself, 'If I had been the last girl on Earth, I wouldn't be here.'"
What does the word "" menu "" mean in Arabic?
Basically, a young boy from Livonia condemned the girl as retarded and deceived.
How could he have said such a thing?
In that moment, I started to think.
Now, this makes me angry.
That's really hard on a person!
I'm not considered fair in my country because I'm speaking my own language.
Where else could this happen?
How'd we get here?
But we are very, very many people here, like me, who go to a stage in their lives where they are drawn in a manner that is irrelevant to everything that has happened to them in the past in order to simply say that they are contemporary and cultural.
Can I forget all my culture, thoughts, thoughts and experiences?
When it comes to an experience as a kid, it can be the best experience of our lives.
All I learned in Arabic was to adapt.
Must I forget to be one of them?
So what's the logic here?
Despite all that, I kept trying to understand it.
I didn't want him to judge me with the brutality that he was judging me with.
Arabic doesn't respond to the demands of the day.
It's not the language of science, of exploration, or the language that we rely on to deliver the big exploration project that we're used to in our offices at universities, and it's not the language that we use at our airports.
If we did, they would remove our clothes.
"" Where should I use my language? "" This is a question we've all got to ask.
Do you want us to use Arabic? Where should we use it?
That's a reality.
But there's another reality that's more important to consider.
Arabic is a mother tongue.
And that search is saying that to be perfect in another language, you have to be perfect in your own mother tongue.
Perfection in mother tongue is needed if we are to express our ideas creatively in other languages.
How come?
Cibran Xjal Cibran first started writing using Arabic.
All of his ideas and his imagination and his philosophy stemmed from this little boy in my village, who grew up with a particular passion, a particular noise.
So when he started writing in English, he already had enough databases.
In fact, when he writes in English, when you read his writing, you feel that touch, you experience that touch.
As you can imagine, there's him, writing in English, this guy coming down the mountains in Lebanon.
And it's not uncommon for anyone to argue with it.
Second thing we often say is, if we want to kill a country, if we want to kill a country, the only way to kill a country is to kill its language.
That's a reality that most advanced societies are aware of.
We Germans, French, Japanese, Chinese, we all know it because we're connected.
And because of that, they've made it a law to protect their language.
So, they have this sacred idea.
So they use it to produce language, and they're spending a lot of money to develop language.
Do we know more about them?
Well, we are not from the developed world, this kind of mindset has not yet caught up with us, and we would like to commune with the cultural world.
We did what was once the case, but when we did development research, when we went to countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, etc., countries that are walking alongside them, when they step out of the wall, they take their language with them, they preserve it as their own.
They loved their language.
Because if you buy a product from Turkey or elsewhere and it doesn't have a Turkish label on it, it's not a local product.
You wouldn't believe it was a local product.
They would be the same buyers we were, unqualified buyers we have lately.
So in order to innovate and produce, they had to preserve their language.
"If I said, "" Freedom, sovereignty, independentness, "" what would that remind you?"
It remembers nothing, right?
Who, how and why.
A language is not just a way that words come out of our mouths and flow out of our mouths to have a conversation.
Language displays the terminology that governs the specific steps in our lives and our emotions.
And therefore, when we say "" freedom, sovereignty, independentness, "" each one of you has a particular image in your mind, a particular history, a particular day of feelings.
A language is not one, two or three words or a letter.
It's this internal idea of how we think, how we see each other, and how others see us.
What is language?
Now, by the way, you might say, that guy understands, right?
And by the way, if I say, "" Freedom, sovereignty, independentness, "" and if your son comes up and says, "Daddy, have you been living in freedom for a while?"
What would that feel like?
If you don't see a problem, it's OK that I go away and I won't go into the room.
The point is that these terms remind us of something very special.
I have a French friend who is married to a Frenchman.
And I asked him one day, I mean, how do things go?
"" It is good, "" he said, "" but one day I worked all night trying to translate for him the word 'toqborni.' "" (Laughter) (Applause) And the lady mispronounced "" toqborni "" and then worked all night trying to translate for him.
He had this quote to his wife that said, "" How can a man be so cruel?
Is he suicidal?
"" Mind me? (In English) "" That's one of the things.
We started to think that, because her husband wasn't going to get it, she couldn't say that to him, and he had the right to not get it. She's a different person.
"" My friend told me, "" He listens to me and to Fairuza, and one night I tried to translate for him so that he would feel what I felt when I listened to Fairuza. "" The lady who was writing for him tried to translate for him: "I extended my fingers out of them and stole you." (Laughter) And here was the problem: "Because you belong to them, I took my fingers back and left you." (Laughter)
Translate this for me.
(Applause) What have we done to protect the Arabic language?
We've turned that into a civil society problem, and we've started a campaign to protect the Arabic language.
"" And, surprisingly, a lot of people used to say to me, "Why do you get nervous?"
"Forget it all and play for yourselves." "No problem!"
"" This is the message that the newspaper language protection campaign was sending: I'm talking to you from the East, and you're responding to me from the West.
We didn't say, "" No! We don't believe it or not. "" We didn't take the same approach because they didn't understand us.
And if someone talks to me about that, I hate Arabic.
We say, (Applause) We want to change our own reality and shape it so that it reflects our dreams, our dreams and our everyday lives.
We bleed because you don't look like us, and you think like us.
"" And of course, "" I'm talking to you from the East, but you're responding to me from the West, "" was a statement.
It's very simple, yet creative and very credible.
And after that, we started another campaign — the writing of letters on the soil.
"You may have seen this example outside, where a hymn is written on a stage with black and yellow curtains all engulfed, "Don't kill the language!"
Why? Don't you really kill the language.
We have to kill our language at birth.
If we were to kill our language, we'd have to find our identity.
It would have to be possible for us to exist.
We'd have to go back to the beginning.
This is a serious issue as well as losing our chances of being modern and cultural.
We then distributed pictures of boys and girls wearing Arabic script.
It had photos of girls and boys on it.
We're cool!
Who says, "" Oh, you used to use an English word! "" I say, "" No! I just have a word for 'cool.' "" So let them decide how much they believe, but give me a better word to describe the reality better.
I am continuing to say "" the Internet. "" I am saying, "" My world is out of sync. "" (Laughter) Because it's no use! We have to deceive ourselves.
But as we get to that point, we have to believe that if the issue is language, we have to let those who are larger than us, or who think they have influence in us, control us, let them think and feel what they want for us.
Creativity is a concept.
If we can't fly into the universe or make rockets or something, we can't be creative.
So all of you right now are a creative project.
Your mother tongue, your creativity, is a self-fulfilling path.
So, let's begin with this moment.
Let's write a novel or make a short film.
That single novel could make us global again.
That could bring the Arabic language back to number one.
It's not fair to say, "" There's no way to talk. There's a way to talk! ""
But we should know and believe that there is a way out, and it is our duty to be part of that way.
To conclude, what can you do today?
So, tweets, who's watching?
If you don't have my time, I'll just ask you, please, to be in Arabic, English, French or Chinese.
But don't write in Arabic with a complex set of numbers in Latin.
(Applause) It's a curse! It's not a language!
You're entering a virtual world with virtual language.
And it's not easy to jump back out of a place like that.
That's the first thing we can do.
Secondly, there's a lot of other things that we can do.
We're not here today to convince each other.
And we are here to bring to the attention of you the importance of preserving this language.
Now, I have a secret for you.
The Körp used to know her father through language for the first time.
When my daughter is born, I'm going to say to her, "" This is your dad, honey. "" I'm not going to say to her in English, "" This is your dad, honey. "" And I'm going to say to my daughter Noora, when she says to me in Arabic in the supermarket, I'm going to say to her, "" Tell me mama, mama, "" and I'm not going to hope nobody heard her.
(Applause) Please, by making us culturally appropriate. (Applause)
And I learned a few things during this 30 days of experimentation.
So, I took a picture every day for a month to prove it.
And that's before I started my 30 days of exploration.
That's awful.
Actually, they are very fun.
(Applause)
Because I had gotten good at school, I had high expectations, and I entered my life as a student with a passion for teaching, with a huge amount of work, and a huge amount of road rage.
And more interestingly, I felt kind of helpless and helpless, afraid of the people that were coming in, afraid of the failure of the future, and the emptiness that I felt inside.
"" At the moment, as it happened, I was breaking down — I was breaking down, like I'd done before, balancing on the back, balancing on the back — and I suddenly heard a very loud voice, "" He's leaving the bed. "" I was dizzy.
And there was absolutely nobody around. The clarity and the accuracy of the explanation that I heard was beyond question.
"" He's opening the door, "" I heard.
It was a beginning. There was a sky.
And I've been doing it for days, and then weeks, and it's all being told to me by some third person somehow.
"He's going to the lecture."
Now, the sound was neutral, it was painful, and it actually sounded friendly and hopeful even after a while, and I also realized that this painful sound actually resonates with my emotions, which I didn't really bring to light at the time.
For example, I often have to articulate my anger and my real feelings when I'm sad, when I have to hide my emotions.
The feedback that came from this was very helpful: normal people don't listen to sounds, and my listening was a very serious insult.
It took me to go to medical school.
Well, I needed that interest and help, and so I started talking about it and explaining it.
"" For example, I was working as a student television host for a campus news program, and during the time I was working as a medical student, I said, "" I want to study. I have to go.
But then things quickly began to flip out of control.
I was put in a sick asylum, diagnosed with schizophrenia, then schizophrenia at the top, and then, worst of all, I had a devastating sense of loss of self and my future, and a sense of jealousy and failure, and helplessness.
That feeling of fear and courage grew when I realized that the voice I was hearing was not an ordinary life experience, but rather a symptom.
The hostile theme that met my mind was a kind of psychic warfare, and as a result the voices got louder and louder and louder and louder.
Do you see that trap that's got water in it?
What came as a result was a period of fear, of runaways, of instability, of incomprehension, and this is a time when I felt like I was not in the process of creating peace, of creating peace in this war, where I felt like I was powerless.
Two years later, my condition started to deteriorate.
I knew the awful things about all that girl: the horrifying voices, the pregnant images, the awful, unintelligible counting.
Now if I look back in the past, as those years went by and became really disappointing, I think one person has died, and one person has been saved.
A bound and tightened person made a journey, and he was able to get out of the city, and finally to return to the person I was supposed to be towards in the end.
Many people have hurt me in my life, and I remember them all, but it was an unfortunate moment, compared to the people who helped me.
I believe that Eleanor will do it.
He said, "" But sometimes when it rains, it rains again. "" It's not enough to thank these beautiful people who stood up for me and stood up for me in 14 minutes and watched me rise from a place of despair and desperation and come back.
And of course, it was hard to believe that before, because the sounds were hostile and people were reacting to it, so the first important thing I had to do was to learn to understand that they were saying the truth utterly.
For example, I learned how to describe the sounds of threatening to attack my house — not as a real and objective danger, but as a feeling of fear and danger I experienced.
Now, sometimes I believed them.
I remember one night, I sat at my parents' door and took theirşiks so I could protect them from the sounds that I considered to be true.
"" Don't have a job with me.
I said, "" Don't you think we have a solution for plastics? "" That's my strategy.
Once I realized this, thankfully, I was able to buy back the fragments of myself from the clump, free from the predatory drugs, this time going back to psychiatry in a completely different role.
I'm currently proud to be a member of the organizational component of Intervoice, the International Society for Human Rights Movement, and that attempt, born out of the work of Prof. Marius Romme and Dr. Sandra Escher, to bring voices to life as a life strategy, as a way of addressing madness, not as an anomaly, not as a gift of schizophrenia, but as something that is hard, important and meaningful to study.
With this kind of society, not only is it possible, it's already being built.
There's a famous phrase that all of us use, that if social change begins, there's no return.
We cannot devalue dignity.
There will be no pressure on people who are not afraid anymore.
Over the past 20 years, the Human Rights Movement has spread to five continents and 26 countries, and working together, we've expanded the opportunities and become pioneers and entrepreneurs for people with different backgrounds, backgrounds, and spiritual challenges, and the basis of our reality is a conversation about human potential.
As Piter Levin said, it's a unique existence with a intellectual spirit to utilize this ability of the human survival instinct.
In that sense, it's the greatest honor in our society — the privilege to help someone who is in need of recovery, to be there, to extend a hand, to share a memory and hope that he can be recovered.
We are unique. We are irreplaceable.
It's not about taking or giving up what we have originally.
şıq is basically extinguished.
There's a doctor who once said to me, "Tell me what your head says about your village."
"Tell me about your life." "Thank you very much."
(Applause)
I'm here to talk about my photography.
Isn't that the art of photography?
Because it's not an image you can take with your camera, of course.
But my love of photography started when I was 15 years old with my first camera.
I added that to the list of my previous pleasures as an artist, but in a slightly different way, because I was planning the process with the camera in advance.
Once you snap a picture with the camera, it's ready for you when the button on the camera is pressed.
For me, it meant that photography didn't just have to be in the right place at the right time.
So I thought, well, maybe everyone could do this.
So I wanted to do something different, and this is what it looked like when you take a picture.
So here are pictures like this: construction continuing on its way to work.
But it turns out it's an unexpected game.
And yet, it looks close to reality.
Or photographs like this — both dark and color, but they're always communicating a certain amount of reality to me.
Now, when I say realism, I mean photo-realism.
Because, of course, these are not pictures that we can actually take, but I wanted them to be pictures that could be seen with the camera somehow.
I just wanted to leave you with a couple of images that you might think about in order for me to get across.
So it really had to do with keeping the memory, more than just keeping the right idea.
Does it really make sense that he looks that way?
Does it have to do with these details or with the colors?
Is it connected to light?
What has led to the illusion?
It's a perspective that sometimes leads to misconception.
But the thing is, how have we done this already, how have we done it in a two-dimensional orchid?
And what's real is not what this reality is, but what what people actually see.
So the concept is very simple.
I see this in bringing together real moments, creating an alternative reality that I create into a realm of truth.
Let me show you a simple example.
So here are three numbers of physical things that can be perfectly imagined, things that are connected to our three-dimensional world.
But when they come together in a certain way, it looks like a three-dimensional object that exists again.
So, the first thing we know is, it just can't exist.
So our brains are playing with our brains because our brains can't recognize what reality is not.
And I see the same process when I draw pictures together.
Well, it had to do with bringing together the different truths.
So there's things that I think a picture really shows, things that we don't think about, things in our daily lives, things around us.
And while you're drawing pictures together, this is really important to know because otherwise it might look wrong.
And so what I would like to say is, there are three simple rules that we follow in order to have a real nəticə.
As you can see, there is nothing special about these images.
But when you put them together, something like this becomes possible.
So the first rule is, the perspectives of the photos that we combine must be the same.
The second thing is, the photos that we make should be the same in the form of light.
And in both cases, they need to be pulled at the same height and at the same light.
The third reason is that it's impossible to hold a picture together and somehow distinguish between where one of them ends and where the other starts.
The way the photograph is made, it has to be combined in a way that cannot be denied and cannot be erased.
And by lining the borders between different pictures by adjusting the color, the contrast, the brightness, the depth of field, the purple and the diffuse, we create this kind of effect whereby the borders between different pictures become purple and translucent, even though there are hundreds of other details in there.
Here is another example.
(Laughter) People might think it's a postcard site, but there's a lot of things underneath that have been modified.
But actually this picture has been created by linking images from different places.
I think it's much easier to create a place, to find a place, and in this way you don't need to change your ideas a little bit.
But this was all planning.
And because the idea came to my mind in the winter, I knew there were some gimmicks to make, to plan and to find different places to add pieces to what I found, essentially.
For example, this picture of a fish is caught catching a fish.
Sahillare is a different space.
Six pieces of water were drawn into a stone bed.
And yes, I even colored my house on the coast of the island in red, so it looks more like the Swedish style.
So, getting a near-real result is, I think, possible with all the planning.
Every time there's a blackout, it starts with an idea.
Then it comes to assemble different images.
In this way, for example, every piece has been built to be very good.
And if you take good pictures, the result is really beautiful, and it can be really realistic.
So we have all the material that we need and the only thing that limits us is our imagination.
So, thank you very much.
(Applause)
Chris Anderson: Julian, hi.
And they said that Wikileaks, like you said, has published more data in recent years than the entire world press has printed in recent years.
Can this be done?
Julian Assange: Yes, can this be true?
I mean, that's worrying how bad the media in the rest of the world is doing, isn't it? I mean, a small group of activists who are able to get more information out to the press around the world.
CA: How are you doing that?
So how do people patent those patents?
How is that conservation principle preserved?
JA: As far as we know, these are people who are leaking data, and there are all kinds of ways that data can get to us.
We're applying to courts in countries like Sweden and Belgium to ban surveillance, to enforce legislation to make it easier to share information online.
It accepts encryption, or the administration itself, envisions it in the way that ordinary news agencies do, formats it — and that can be a little difficult when you're having these giant data bases — releases it to the public and protects us against any possible backlash of politics.
CA: So to say that the legality of the patents is guaranteed, you often don't know who the data source is.
JA: Right. We rarely know. We would destroy that information instantly if we found the source of the information.
(Phone ringing) Zibil.
(Laughter) CA: I think it's the CIA asking for the organic code for TED. (Laughter)
So let's take a look at some of these.
This is data that was leaked a few years ago.
Look at this documentary.
This is a story from Kenya.
How can you tell that story about leaking?
JA: This document is the Kroll Report.
This was a study done by the Kenyan government after the election in 2004.
Until 2004, Kenya was run by Daniel Arab Moi for 18 years.
My grandfather was a dictator in Kenya.
When you come under the leadership of Kibabi and the Coalition forces and they start to fight the corruption, they publish these joint reports saying they're spending two million pounds.
The government used this report as political force against Moi, the richest man in Kenya at the time and now.
It's like the sacred book of Kenyan journalism.
On December 28, 2007, just before the December 28 elections, I went to Kenya and I could get the patents.
This report we released three days after the new president of Zimbabwe, Daniel Arap Moin, started getting closer and closer to the people who are going to hand over his money, and after this event, the report hit the president of Zimbabwe.
CA: So, the short story — this was reported to the Kenyan press not directly, so by some means, and you think that changed the outcome of this election.
JA: Yeah. And this was published first on the Guardian front page, and then in all the countries around Kenya, Tanzania and Djibouti Africa.
And news is out.
Over the next couple of days, the Kenyan press started covering the issue more comfortably.
It was published in the Kenyan press for 20 days consistently, and according to the Kenyan security ministry reports, it changed 10 percent of the votes, dramatically changing the election results.
CA: So the data that you're leaking has really changed the world?
JA: Yes.
(Applause) CA: This time, there's a video about an airstrike in Baghdad.
The video itself is a bit long. It's a short clip.
First of all, I would like to tell you there's a little bit of a twist on this video.
Radio:... dust, if they just open up.
You can see it now. You can see it in the sun.
So, it's Aydın. The sun.
So the news, when they see it all, it flashes.
Grab them all.
The sun, the sun!
(Gunshot) Go ahead, go ahead. (Gunshot) Go ahead.
Hotel... Bushmaster Two-Six, Bushmaster Two-Six,
We had to go back, now!
In fact, we killed all eight of them.
We've got two vertices, and we're starting to come back out.
It did. They all died.
Two-six, two-six is talking, we move.
Oops. Sorry. What was that?
Job, Kyle. Aha, solved, hahaha.
CA: So what's been the impact of this video?
JA: Yeah, it's heavy for people with hands.
Two people were sent out to Baghdad to do a survey to find out about this video.
This is actually one of the three attacks in the video.
CA: I mean, as far as I'm concerned, 11 people, including two Reuters employees, were killed in that attack?
JA: Yeah. Two Reuters workers were killed, two children were injured.
In total, 18 to 26 people died.
CA: Now, the publication of this did spark international outrage.
What do you think was the main reason for this outrage and outrage?
JA: Well, I don't know, I think people have seen the inhumanity of power.
The Apache guerrillas, who fly on top of people who are walking comfortably off the coast — laughing with 30-millimeter guns, not for a reason — and even killing those who have been rescued.
There were two journalists who knew exactly what they were doing, that they weren't spies.
CA: U.S. security agent Bradley Manning was arrested and reportedly told that in his interrogation room he had leaked videos as well as the writings of 280,000 U.S. citizens.
Isn't that true?
JA: Well, we've denied that we got that data.
Five days ago, he was arrested because he had leaked 50 of his 150,000 documents.
Earlier this year, we published the patents of the U.S. government in Reykjavik, and they have nothing to do with this.
I was on a trip to that city myself.
CA: If you could get the diplomatic patents of the U.S. government?
JA: We would publish them. (CA: Would you do that?) JA: Yes. (CA: Why not?) JA: The patents that come with bells like that track the actual state of the country, the fact that, in the Arab countries, people's rights are being violated.
So, if you open the patents for the secrets, these are the materials.
CA: We'll talk a little bit more about that in more detail.
What ideology do you espouse?
So what's the main reason that you think the publication of the secret patents works?
JA: So the question is, what kind of information is important to the world, what kind of information could lead to a restructuring?
In fact, there's a lot of talk.
So it's very exciting that so many organizations have so much economic power to hide information, that when that information comes in, it's going to be something new and good, and so institutions that have that information are very good at keeping information hidden.
In practice, it happens all the time, and the history of journalism is indebted to this.
CA: But isn't it just dangerous that, when there is a leak, it could have devastating consequences for everyone in the community, regardless of who you are?
JA: But that's not the case with the data that we're disseminating.
So we have a policy of protecting against harm.
And there's some personal information that they have about themselves that we tie to them and then release.
There's also some hidden legal secrets — the doctor's advice, for example, these secrets are preserved under the law, but we're working with intelligence agencies to figure out what exactly it is that they're doing.
CA: You know, she's pretty good at everything.
Or if you have a person whose son serves in the U.S. military and comes up to you and says, "" Do you know that you have a documentary that somebody wants to create for them? Here's a video.
A U.S. military man laughs when people die.
That tells millions of people around the world that American soldiers are not human. They're not.
Not even my son. How dare you do that? "" What would you say?
JA: Well, there's a lot of this, actually.
But remember, people in Baghdad, Iraq, Afghanistan don't need to see this video; they see it every day.
They're not changing their minds. They're not changing their preferences, their feelings.
They have these hallucinations every day.
It'll only change the way that people are funding for war. And that's what we want.
CA: So you've found a way to enlighten the governments and companies about the secrets.
Light is good.
But the strange thing is, to enlighten the secrets, you have to keep your own resources secret.
JA: Not exactly. But there have been those who objected to WikiLeaks.
Or we don't have data that is counter-productive for some resources.
If this is the case and it continues to happen, it might be hard for us, and we work hard to get people to do our jobs, to help us do our jobs, rather than doing things that hurt us.
CA: So, what I've been hearing a lot lately is, I'm actually curious — what's the reaction of TED people to this?
Now, there are two kinds of ideas about WikiLeaks and Julian.
One — hero that picks the right things to light up.
The second is the dangerous rollercoaster.
How many of you think you're going to be a hero?
And what about the dangerous rollercoaster?
JA: Well, at least we should have a couple.
CA: These are sound people, Julian.
We have to work a little bit more. Let me show you another example.
This time it's not going to be published, I think, but it's going to be published at TED.
Interesting stuff is happening, isn't it, recently?
What is that document?
JA: And this is an example of a work we can do every day.
Now late last year — November — there were things like explosions in Albania in the Gulf of Mexico, which weren't as violent as they were in the Gulf.
We got such an engineering report that the actual way competition works is by blowing up trucks, which are put out by companies' preservators.
The government of Albania, and others, have their hands on this.
The great report had nothing to do with it. It was a bit of a difficult document.
We had no idea who wrote what or what it was about.
And we were a little suspicious that competition could be a game for oil industry as well.
So we looked at the patents, and we wrote down, "Well, we're a little suspicious."
We have no idea what we're going to do about it.
It's another document. Looks good, but we can't prove it. "" A week ago, we tried to find a source of data, and we got an answer from a company that publishes this — (Laughter) that said, "" We want to find a source of data. "" We said, "" Please give us some data.
What document are you talking about in the meeting?
Do you know they're a national law?
They said, "" Is it really you? "" They then put a microsoft Word ID on the screen, and a portrait of the person who made the document.
That's how he built it.
(Applause) Actually, there's a lot of this.
Determining the nature of material is one of the ways to write a letter.
CA: And so, and BP, do you have all that information?
JA: Yeah, well, a lot, but we're still funding this website and the engineers are doing fantastic.
Over the past few months, we've been redesigning the website and reducing the amount of content that is published, in order to protect the public interest that we have.
That's a little bit of a problem.
So in another institution that has started another activity, one of our biggest challenges has been this: we have a situation where we have a lot of data, and we have a lot of data in liquid form, but we don't have enough people to produce and publish all of this data.
CA: So what you're asking for is money to pay basic volunteers and/or executives for salaries?
JA: Yeah. It's the people we believe in.
Because the data that we have is sometimes obtained in a slightly different way, it's difficult to develop things suddenly. We need people who are able to take high-level and sometimes security decisions.
CA: And can you tell us why he started doing that?
If I think I read somewhere, you've changed 37 schools in your childhood.
Is that data true?
JA: Well, my parents were involved in the movie business, and I actually ran away from a religious ceremony, which was the result of both of them.
(Laughter) CA: You know, I mean, psychologists, this is a little bit of a metaphor for paranoia, right?
JA: What do you mean, the movie business?
(Laughter) (Applause) CA: Well, I know that at a young age, you were also pretty deaf, so you had problems with your slides.
JA: I was just a journalist.
I was an activist and a young journalist.
I was arrested because I published this journal when I was a young man.
We need to be a bit resourceful with our resources.
There's so many different things you can do with greed.
Unfortunately, many of these hackers today are simply stealing money from your grandmother's bank account to be used by the Russian mafia.
The previous one is not the same.
CA: Well, it doesn't come to mind that you had to steal somebody's grandmother's money. What are the real values?
Can you give them some short information about what happened, or why did something happen to them, or what's causing them?
JA: Well, I don't think anything has happened.
But my basic values: I think capable and generous people don't create the victims; they help the victims.
And it's been my life that I've learned from my father, and from all the wonderful people that my father is.
CA: But the courageous, compassionate people don't create the victims; they preserve them?
JA: Well, I'm a victim-protectionist by night, so I don't show the wing, I just completely protect the victims by the way — by tracking criminals.
That is my character that I've long admired.
CA: Can you just give a short talk, just in the last few minutes, about what's going on in Iceland?
The data that it published showed that there was a problem with the bank, and news organizations that published the data were sued.
The website was launched instead.
You created a great reputation in Iceland. Then what happened?
JA: Well, it's been a big challenge.
There was the economic crisis in Iceland.
It was one of the biggest crises in the world.
But net income in the banking sector was up 10 times that of any other sector.
We published this information last July.
"" Five days before it was published in the government newspaper, five days before they were tried in court, like in the movies, five days before their judicial execution news, and they started and the host didn't know what to do, "This has never happened to me. What do we do now?"
We didn't just broadcast news via TV, we did live TV, and we got a lot of excitement in Iceland, and we went and talked about it.
So everybody in society knew that this was not going to happen again. So after talking to a few Icelandic politicians and international experts, we presented to the Icelandic government a new law project that would be the protection of the lawyers, and this law is one of the best good laws that serves to protect politicians in the world, along with his Nobel Prize for freedom of speech.
Iceland joined the Scandinavian countries as well, as did Norway.
And just a month ago, this law was passed under secrecy in the Icelandic parliament.
CA: Wow.
(Applause) Last question, Julian.
How do you think that's going to be the future? Do you think that the Big Brother is going to come in and control everything in secret, or do you think that people are going to watch the Big Brother control everything, or is it going to be different?
JA: I'm not quite sure what's going to happen.
Freedom of speech and transparent legislation is increasing all over the world — from the U.S. to China to the U.S.
It's very hard to see what's going to happen in the future.
And I think this is an interesting period of time, because we can change things very rapidly.
CA: If I hear what people are saying, Julian, be resourceful, have the power.
JA: Thank you so much, Chris. (CA: Thank you.) (Applause)
I am a writer.
my job is to tell stories and write novels, and I want to talk to you today a little bit about the art of storytelling, and also a little bit about what's called artificial intelligence.
But before I do that, let me tell you my very personal story.
I'm going to use words, of course, but from a geometric shape — so you'll see a couple of circles when you listen to me.
I was born in Strasbourg to a Turkish family in France.
Shortly after that my parents were divorced, and I came to Turkey as an equal with my mother.
Since then, I've been raised on the fringes of my mother's throne as a child.
In the 1970s, in Ankara, the situation was a little strange.
Most of the families we lived in were large families, where my father was a family leader, and I grew up next to my mother, who was the only woman left behind in the patriarchal environment.
I grew up in the middle of two groups of women.
On the one hand, she was the traditional, contemporary, European Turkish woman — mother.
On the other hand, I had an older grandmother who was always kind to me — a little less religious, a little less ambitious, a little less rational.
My grandmother, with a brown coffee mug on her finger, would look at the falafel, and she would dip it into different varieties to make the devil's eyesight worse.
People with deep livers on their faces, shaky hands, visited my grandmother.
Every time my grandmother spoke Arabic, she was wearing as many golden tusks as she could get for the red one.
And then he would all be in kind of a mess with each other's legs.
A week later, she came out for the final interview.
I know that it might sound strange to say these things in front of such an educated and well-connected crowd, but I have never seen anyone who came to my grandmother's home to remedy their various ailments, and none of them were picked up or rehabilitated.
I asked my grandmother, what was she doing? What was that noise like?
And he said, "" Of course there are gods, but the power of the fundamental circles. "" And there's a very important lesson in what I've learned from him, which is if you want to destroy something in life, if you want to leak it, if you want to suppress the bottom line, or the soul of a person, you have to take it and roll it around with tall walls.
You'll notice that it sort of contracts down inside.
We are all now deeply embedded in social and cultural circles.
We are all in it.
But we were all born into a particular family, a ring family, a family of concubines.
But if you're not familiar with any extraterrestrial planets, and you're not allowed to interact with them, you run the risk of getting trapped inside them. That's the way we do it.
We can lose our natural strength. We're co-ed. And when we're older, and we're in a much older environment, we lose our sense of humanity.
If we're told that we're internal to our friends, to our neighbors, to our business partners, to our family, that that's irrelevant, and if we're too attached to it, then we're pretty much internal to it.
Women like my grandmother in the government do something like this, they put a bucket over the mirror, or they turn their faces opposite the mirror to the wall.
This is far from the belief that there is such a thing as an Eastern view, that it's quite uncomfortable for a person to look at what they're looking at for a while.
Now, oddly enough, communalism in many ways is one of the greatest dangers in our globalized world, as we move forward.
And it's happening all over the place, from the liberals and the conservatives, to the agnostics and the believers, to the rich and the poor, in the East and in the West.
We start from ignorance and similarities that create groups, and we create stereotypes about others.
I think that artistic creativity could be the key to overcoming these culturalghettos.
Though stories don't know the boundaries, there can be holes in the surfaces of our minds.
From these insights, we can see other worlds, and we can even enjoy what we see.
Since the age of eight, I started to write stories.
One day my mother gave me a sample of her hair in color, and she said it would be a good idea to write my own stories here.
I think I was a little bit afraid of my thoughts at the time.
I was good at telling my stories to my family at home, but I was not so good at telling my crazy friends.
I was an introverted kid, so much so that I would dance with dancing saucers and apologize for the things I touched, but my mother figured that it was a good idea to write my own daily counters.
But he didn't know that I was thinking of my life becoming incredibly intense, and the last thing I wanted to do was write about my crazy life.
Instead, I began to write about myself, not about others, and about things that weren't.
This is how I began to write, what has become my lifelong love.
So when I first wrote, I thought about self-portraits, but more than self-portraits were about other people's lives, other people's stories.
I want you to pay attention. (Laughter) So I'm going to tell you through drawing what's going on in my life.
Something else happened out of the circles.
My mother became a diplomat.
At the same time, I came out of this little, neglected, middle-class environment that I was brought into, this wonderful international school environment in Madrid, and I was the only Turk in that school.
"I entered here for the first time in a difficult environment that I defined as 'typical foreigner.' There were kids from every country in the world, but this created an environment of eclectic democracy, regardless of whether it was a cosmopolitan or an academic in the classroom."
In fact, in this school model, kids were seen as not representing themselves, but a greater entity.
We were all united in the United Nations, and it was very much amusing, not to have a bad thing happening on people's behalf or not to have a religious conversation.
And that way, that childhood became a fascination, and it was always celebrated.
And I remember very well, when I was in high school, there was a military coup in Turkey, a Turkish army attempted to kill the Pope, and at the Eurovision music festival, the country got no mace.
(Laughter) There were times when I would run away from school and dream of becoming a seaman.
I saw, for the first time, a cultural stereotype in this school.
"" All the kids were asking about the Midnight Express that I didn't look at, and they were asking me how many cigarettes I smoked a day, how many Turks every day I smoked, and at the beginning, how old am I to start covering up?
I learned three things about the government here: politics, smoking and headscarves.
After Spain, we went back to Ireland, Germany and back to Ankara.
And I thought, this is the only journey that I can take with me, my imagination, and my imagination's power, on all our journeys.
And the stories reminded me of a sense of oneness, of continuity, of fellowship that I really needed, because in real life, I was deprived of that.
When I was 20, I moved to the city of Istanbul, which I loved.
And I lived in a very cosmopolitan and vibrant environment, and I've written a selection of my novels, too.
I was there when the 1999 earthquake happened in Istanbul.
I stood on a stage at three in the morning looking out of the terminal building and it stopped me.
There was a very elderly, wealthy salesman, who, in his shop, he didn't sell alcohol, he didn't speak to men from the outside, and he didn't speak to people from the margins.
She had a long black lump on her head, and she was sitting next to a transectile tissue that had spread over her eyebrows.
I saw a man offering him one of the cigarettes he picked out of his pocket with his shaking hands, and I think of the earthquake scene that night — the transition between the guard and the seller crying and the guy taking the cigarette together on the deck.
When we're faced with death and decay, our cultural differences take a few hours to break, and sometimes they even take a few hours, but we're all together.
But I've always believed that stories have that kind of effect.
I don't want to say that government is as powerful as an earthquake, but when we read a good novel, we step out of our own little comfortable rooms, and we come to know people we never meet in the dark of the night, and sometimes we're not sure what to think about.
Soon after that, I was in Boston, and I went to girls' college in Michigan.
And it was a profound change, not just geologically, but also in my view of language.
I started writing in English.
Teachers, immigrants, I've had some legal migration, they ask me every day why I don't write English, and changing my language helps me innovate.
I love to write in Turkish, because then I would write more poetically and emotionally, and I love to write in English because then I would think it would be more logical and rational.
I think of each word as being connected in a different way.
And I learned it later, like millions of people around the world, that English is a win-win.
When you learn a language after that, you're doomed to lose what you've learned, forever.
As a result, as the language comes in, we want to have more conversations, we want to make better words, we want to do better crafts, and as a result, we talk less, because our brains and our languages are so different.
That's a fear of difference.
But when we learn not to be afraid of it, it just kind of gets in the way.
This is what I found out in Boston — that the disconnection and the failure that I experienced was a stimulus.
At that time, all my activities came from my grandmother, who, with increasing anxiety, watched from day to day in my daily prayers, brought them into my home, so that according to her, I could only be in one place for a moment after the dance.
I started a family life because God loved my grandmother.
(Laughter) But instead, I decided to go to Arizona.
And because my wife was in Istanbul, I started walking between Istanbul and Arizona, and I couldn't have felt the difference anymore in two places in the world.
So a part of me has always been really transient, I think, physically and spiritually.
It's just that my stories are always with me, because I keep all my moments and parts of myself with me.
But I also think that when he relates a story to reality rather than to a story, he loses his magic.
I'd like to share a tale of that with you.
One of the things I wrote in English was that one of the literary critics when they saw the lighthouse in America explained it like this.
"" I liked the book, "" she said, "but it's a little different this morning."
(Laughter) I asked him what he wanted to say.
He said, "" You see, there are a lot of Spanish and American and pan-American heroes, but there's only one Turkish hero, and that's the man. "" He actually dated me on campus in Boston. It was normal for me to have heroes from countries other than Turkey, but I understand what he's saying.
But I know I'll always regret it.
He wanted this to be my personal manifest.
She wanted the book to be a Turkish woman, because I am a Turkish woman.
We are constantly talking about how stories are changing the world, but at the same time we are seeing how policies are impacting the way that facts are spread and read and understood.
Many writers, especially non-Western writers, are exposed to this.
If you are a woman in the Islamic world like me, you are expected to not write about Islamic women, and if this Muslim woman is not happy, it will be better.
They're expecting you to write no more informative, sad, cynical, typical stories, and not be further from the Western vicissitudes.
The nightmares I experienced as a child in Madrid still exist in contemporary literature.
writers are not seen as creative people with their own ideas, but as representatives of their cultures and countries, some from China, some from Turkey, some from Nigeria.
They expect us to be accompanied, not individually, but in our culture.
In 1984, when the writer and traveler James Baldw was interviewed, they asked him several questions about homosexuality.
"" Those who took the Internet to find him extraordinary as a blue writer, "" Baldwin stood up and said, "" Do I not see that I have nothing that no one else has, and that what I have is the same as what everyone else has. "" Our liberation of imagination is in jeopardy when politics labels us.
There is an unconventional form of literature called superstitious literature, which is what not all writers in the West follow.
About 10 years ago, I remember the first very loving reading room in Harvard Square.
We were three writers, one from Philippi, one from Germany, one from Indonesia — crazy.
(Laughter) But what united us wasn't literature or connections.
We just had our passports.
writers from every other country are looking forward to writing authentic stories.
There's a function to religion.
This way, not only do writers, but their heroes get more recognition.
And I should note that this kind of approach to storytelling doesn't just exist in the West.
And so it is all over the world.
I first saw it in 2005 when they were sued for talking about the heroes that I just mentioned.
I was trying to create a constructive, holistic piece for women's eyes about the Turkish and international family.
When my little story was brought to the court, it became a major macro-problem.
Because I write about Turkish-Armenian relations, some people used to criticize me, some people disapproved.
But at that moment, I would like to tell both sides that this is just literature.
It's just a story.
I don't want to minimize the value of what I see when I say "" just a story. ""
I love and support science not because of how it's understood, but because of how it is.
Writers are known for their political views, but political books are not enough today, and the language of literature is not the language of everyday policy.
President Chekhov said, "" The ignorance and the way in which the issues are dealt with are completely different concepts.
"It is the work of an artist to make a second one. "" Politics is what separates us. It unites science.
One involves generalizations.
The other thing is, it makes a huge difference.
One draws the line.
The other has no frontier.
The political deadlock has been fixed.
City from dirty water.
And there were people who, in the Ottoman period, used to tell mobile stories called "" magic. "" They would go to prisons, and in front of the audience they would tell stories that were, for a long time, amazing.
They could change their voices, mimic them, to represent different faces of the story.
Everybody wanted to hear it, ordinary people, even the sultan, Muslims, non-Muslims.
"The stories dried up to the limits, stretching out to Central Asia, North Africa, the Balkans and Asia, like the ultimate leader of the pack.
And today, stories continue to push the boundaries.
When Palestinian and Israeli politicians talk, they don't listen to each other, but a Palestinian reader who is an Israeli writer reads a Palestinian writer, and an Israeli reader is a Palestinian writer, and the way the story is told is through dialogue.
The government has to take us up a road.
If you can do that, this is not such a good əsər.
The books have saved me — what once was a troubled and shameful kid.
But books are in danger of being truncated.
After the writer and Sufi master Rumi met his spiritual wife, Sa'am Bible, the first thing Sa'am did was he threw his books into the water and he watched them destroy what was written in them.
"" To the Sufi, "" knowledge that cannot alienate you is better than ignorance. "" The problem with cultural ghettos today is not lack of diversity or knowledge. We know each other so much, we think we know each other best, and by extension, we're not alienating ourselves, we're elitist, we're alienating others, and we're creating bonds.
There's a similarity, which I love, and it's that we live in the act of a compass.
One of the dances of the company is always constant.
The other performer is constantly echoing, constantly spinning.
So that's my əsərləri.
I mean, one part of my writing, one part has been rooted in Turkishness in Istanbul, and the other part moves the world and connects different cultures around the world.
So I think, in my view, my əsərləri are both local and universal, and they belong everywhere.
So some of you who have been to Istanbul have probably seen the Palace of Topkapi, which in 1400 was the domain of the Ottoman sultans.
There is a place in Sarajevo, outside the gate of the synagogue, called the Meeting of the Genders space.
And in between the buildings is that place.
So I like that approach a lot.
We don't usually believe in the sites in between.
We think of those places as the bust of a long lineage of super-organisms that came out of the dust-free sun and were considered to be the symbols of change.
What I believe is that the ərazis should be the art's memory.
When I'm writing, I put a premium on variety and diversity.
I love not thinking about 10 pages later.
I love the fact that my friends are surprised at me.
In one of my novels, I can write about a Muslim woman, and she'll probably be a happy woman, or the heroine of my next novel, which will be a redeemed, blue-collar professor from Norway.
As we get inside, we can tell it all.
"" Audo Lorde says, "" Our intelligent fathers say, 'Sorry, it means we can.' "" And he says, "" Excuse me, it means I can. "" I thought that was a great example.
And I don't understand why we're still telling writers to write about what they know.
Maybe not a great place to start.
Creativity is not about who we are, what we know, and how we identify as individuals.
We need to teach scientists and each other to write about where we feel open-hearted.
You have to get away from the body ghettos. You have to know other worlds.
They're like needles that constantly draw circles and circle around.
It doesn't matter what their political situation is, they are bringing people together. And that is good news.
And I thought I would end my talk with an ancient Sufi line, saying, "" Let's meet tomorrow, let's listen to friends, let's talk things out; let's love love; the world is a crazy world. "" Thank you very much.
(Applause)
My great idea is a small idea that will detect millions of great ideas hidden within us.
I have this little idea that I like to put to sleep.
(Laughter) (Applause) Here are the women from my group, "" Women in Action. "" The odd one is
These are the women.
So I found it very hard to appreciate the value of dreaming.
Two and a half years ago, I started to complain of fatigue.
I was sitting at a table, my face was clouded, and I had five marks thrown in my right eye.
That's when I really began to appreciate what value was.
And I went through that process, talking to doctors, talking to scientists, and finally, I can say to you, the only way you can be more productive and happy is to sleep normal.
(Applause) In the future, we women will be leaders.
We'll be the ultimate laughers, literally.
(Laughter) (Applause) Because unfortunately, there are so few sleeper people who count on movement.
Not that long ago, she was naked with a man and she started talking about how she slept four hours in the night before that.
"" And, as I said to you last night, "" Of course I didn't say that. "" But you know what?
Wouldn't the current bathing experience be more interesting if it lasted five hours? "" (Laughter) Most men spend less time waking up.
If you want to invite somebody down to Washington, DC, for breakfast in the morning and you ask them, "" What's 8 o'clock like? "" they'll probably say, "" It's 8 o'clock, sir, it's fine, let's go play tennis, let's call some mates, then I'll see you. "" They may think they're very busy, very productive, but I don't think they are, because there are enough leaders out there making very bad decisions in the economic, political and commercial sectors right now.
getting high I.Q.
To be a good leader, not just to be a good leader, is to see the beginning of the month before it touches Titan.
So, we already have plenty of Titanians on our planet.
I think if Lehman Brothers were Lehman Brothers and the Brothers, they would still be alive.
(Applause) If these boys were to sleep 24 hours a day, seven and a half hours a day, or eight hours a day, they would be conscious, they might understand what's going on.
In a time of massive crisis, it is the best thing in the world for anything that can make us happy, that can make us effective, that can do good for us anywhere in the world.
I challenge you once again that to see the great ideas in you, to open your eyes to this artificial eye, to use your devices, to discover the power of dreaming.
Thank you very much indeed.
(Applause)
And I was like a baby, when you're a woman, when you have babies.
As you probably know, the brain is made up of two separate compartments.
Please give me a minute — thank you very much. It was fun.
Now that information, converted into energy, is transmitted at the same time to all of our emotional systems, what this object looks like, how it smells, how it tastes, how it feels, how it sounds.
We're an energy that's wired to the environment, transmitted via our right brain.
So at this point, we are perfect, we are perfect, we are beautiful.
Now your left hemisphere of the brain, quite a different place.
The left hemisphere conjures up a methodology.
And our left brains make sense of a language.
The only thing I knew was foreign energy — that was power.
"" What could you see for me? "" he asked.
I feel a sense of insignificance in my bones. Bear with me.
