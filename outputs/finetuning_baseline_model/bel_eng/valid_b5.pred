(Arab) I'm looking for a story from Satan in Alah, called Alah, a milestrian and milestrian.
I was born in a middle class family.
That's why I was so frustrated.
My mother was born 16 children.
From 16 children, only five remained alive.
Imagine what my childhood was.
Every day, I've seen women who were going to go to dinner, or kids who went to see their muscles.
I wanted to be a doctor to help women and children.
Unfortunately, in my country, there wasn't Internet for girls, so I was taken into the middle school, but I couldn't visit it.
And my father sent me to America.
I moved to America.
I finished my education.
Since I was learning, my country came to the Russian military.
You know when I went to college, I didn't even know what happened with my family and my country.
There were months, years, but I didn't know anything.
My family was in refugees camps.
Once I finished the study, I moved my family to America.
I wanted them to live in security.
Where was my heart?
My heart was in Afghanistan.
I had a good job.
I learned to the university.
And then I went to the refugee camp.
When I went to this camp in Pakistan, I saw 7,5 million refugees, 7,5 million refugees.
About 90 percent of them were women and children, and most of the men were lost or violated, and you know when I was in the refugee camp.
When I've done every day research, I told things you can't imagine.
I saw a success with 5-8 kids sitting and crying, and she didn't know what to do.
I saw a young woman who couldn't go anywhere, didn't have education, fun, who didn't even have a place for life.
It was a very aburious situation.
At that moment, we talk about impuls.
At that moment, I asked myself, ""What can I do for these people?""
How can I help them?
At that moment, I realized that education changed my life.
She changed me and gave me status.
At that moment, I realized that I had to give my people education and health, and that I started to work.
Do you think I was easy?
Not because at that moment, education was completely distracted by a girl.
"The problem was to come and say, ""I want to do this."" Who's I?"
Have you believed me? Naturalally, not.
That's why I had to install a computer in this community.
How was I going to do that?
I was looking at and looking at, looking at.
I tried.
I was 80 years old.
He was brave.
"And he looked at me, and he said, ""Laughter, woman, girl. How can I be a teacher?"" And I said to him, ""I'm going to be a teacher."" And finally, he said, and when I started with his idea, the news began to spread."
For one year, we had 25 schools, and 15,000 children who were going to these schools, and it was amazing.
Naturally, we work, we encourage teachers, we teach women's rights, human rights, principles of democracy, justice, we're doing different training. One time, I'm going to tell you,
One time I was in the office in Beijing, Pakistan.
"And then I've seen how my employees walk to the room, shut the doors and call me, ""Laughter!"" If you're the leader you do?"
You're angry. You know that it's dangerous.
You know that your life is on the corner.
But as a leader, you have to be strong.
You have to marry and show power.
So I asked them to me.
They went into, and they've found tattoos.
I asked them to sit, and I gave them a hard drive.
They refused, and they said that they didn't drink.
Naturally, their tone, the voice they talked with me, really lost me, and I really trossed.
But I was strong, I was hard.
"They said, ""What do you do?"
My employees started to go to the office.
They continued to open the clicks.
They worked with my mother and kids.
They've conducted training about women's health.
We've conducted all the training you can only imagine.
I was happy, and I was happy with the results of my work.
The only four coaches, one protector, and I went from Kabul, and again, unexpectedly, we stopped the middle of the journey of 19 men.
With bees on the surface, they put us the way.
That's the time we all forget."
We know where you were going.
All went home, nobody left.
I had only a protector, and I lost my voice.
There were hundreds of women to get education.
Well, I was sitting and unexpected — at that moment, we talk about impuls, and at that moment, one of my wonderful donors was talking about the job.
"And she asked, ""Laughter?"" I said to her."
Today, these people are my best coaches.
And ... (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)
It shows that education can change people.
I live in a country that was beautiful and good.
I want to share with you.
We could go where we wanted.
Do you know what happened to my country?
Today, people can't go out of the house, not focus on security.
But we want to return to our old Afghanistan.
They get diplomas and learn on the distance.
Who said that compassion and love can be fascinated by the world.
Superficiency: What do you want?
Client: Gmm, let's look.
Server: I'm going to make a low-cutting design of a place, which's patched by the best printed data, two-coded crops, butterbrides with an operational, a CFC car, to this salate with a polymorphic pollination shelves, and a coded crops.
Client: I want to get a battery with an operational memory, and you get a bit of your best hair code.
Server: Is there anything in the room?
We have a number of high data works.
Client: Don't give a collection of robots if you want.
Server: It's the fastest.
I'm fast serving your order.
(Applause) My Pen: I'm painting from your couple how I learned to keep the voice in my hand, and I'm painting multiple characters in children from 3 years old age.
And then I learned who were these animaters.
On the TV, they showed a program of professions that most children don't know.
"When I realized that the animators were those that I've seen on the screen, I just said, ""I want to be animator!"" I don't know if I realized that, or I said that, or myself, but it was a big major moment of my life."
Pictures and art were always my favorite things.
"But the interest in computer technologies created the idea of creating the animation ""The Gold Tree."" ("Malicious Dishes", which is the beginning) I had a virus on my computer, I tried to look at it, and suddenly I thought, and what if there was my little world in the virus in the middle of the computer?"
Maybe there's any scale where they're assembled to publish together?
"So they were born, ""The golden food.""
When I was four years old, my father showed me how to pick up the computer on parts and make it back.
So I felt hard to computer technologies.
I built my first online computer in HTML, and now I learned JavaScript and Python languages.
"And I'm also developing a new animation called ""Applause."" It's about bees and other inventors that exist in the neighborhood, and why they're useful."
If flowers didn't look at these detectors, all of the creation that depends on the plant, we've finally died from the voice.
So I decided to use these file creation and do their superhero team.
(Applause) (Applause of foot) (Music) (Applause) Asker: Ablause! Who's more!
You need to call the rest of the aspirants.
(Music) Thank you. (Applause) All of my animations started with the idea, but what are the ideas?
These ideas can inspire their hands.
These ideas are compassion and new development.
Because of the idea, the world is really cool.
If we don't have ideas, we would not be where we're here now, there were no technical or medical results, there were no art, culture, our lifestyle.
"When I was eight years old, I took my ideas and open the company ""My idea,"" and there's a foundation ""My idea for the planet.""
(Laughter) I produce an ecological mix and oxygen.
I'm now 13, and regardless of what I started with a company in 2008, my art development started before.
Great impact on me always showed art, and I wanted to help him to everything I do, including my company.
And when we've got a little bit different, I thought that I could make a piece or a piece — I had so many ideas of material manufacturing.
"And I noticed that when I made my products, I stopped on the street with a question, ""How beautiful. Where can I buy this?""
And I thought that I could do this and open a company.
Because I was only eight years old, I didn't have any special business development plans.
I just knew I wanted to produce beautiful things that would not lose the environment, and I wanted to share with those who had less than I spent in my life.
My mother taught me to write, and I was sitting on the bottom of my house, and I made links on the head of the strip, and I wrote the name and the price for each of my product.
I started to create more products like shakes, shakes and shakes.
My product started to buy around the world, and I had customers in Denmark, Italy, Australia, Canada and other countries.
And I realized, I had a lot of things to learn about the management of things like, for example, corporate name and sales, how to support customer relationships and monitor what is done better or worse.
The small company started to grow.
"And once I was 10 years old, I had to join the Forbes magazine."
(Laughter) They wanted to write about me and my company in their classroom.
So many people ask me, why are my ecological products?
From a small age, I really interested in the environment and the creation that they live.
My parents ran to teach me to share with those who were less compassionate, and with the mind and the desire to go to the environment.
I learned that textile color or even the process would produce things that are dangerous for people and planet, and I started my research, and I found that even after coloring there was a problem for the environment in what it wasn't known to do with waste.
With the rest of the process of coloring, or with the rest, the most dry color.
It contaminates the air that makes it taxable for everyone who respirates.
So when I started with a company, I knew two things: all my products have to be ecological, and 10-20 percent of my income should be offered to local and global well-being organizations.
(Applause) I consider myself a part of the new call of entrepreneurs who don't just want to pay money, but also hope for the sustainable development of the world.
I believe that I can fix my customers, and I'm just going to be able to improve future generations to live more ecological clean lives.
We live in a big, different and beautiful world, and then I'm going to pay more to protect it.
Imagine what happens in the world only through my head and my mind is not enough.
All you need to be done through your heart, because it's then that it's the idea of organizing your hands.
Just then, compassion and invention see the world, so ideas do reality.
Thank you all for measure and happiness.
(Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Pete Mitchell: You've heard how I talked about my parents who are behind this magic woman. Where are they?
Please, Pan's compassion and compassion, you can ... You.
(Applause)
Here's a few findings of the connectivity of galaxies.
The name is really identical.
They're managed by these beautiful collections of galaxies that are connected to each other with a collective gravitation.
The major step you see on the screen is not the only stars, but the collection of stars or galaxies.
Now, showing you some of these findings, I hope you soon see that the fusion of galaxies is not just a beautiful object, but more than that, I think that the fusion of galaxies is dark, they're sure, and they're brave.
They're critical as the source of the most powerful laboratory universe.
And in your role as a laborator, the assumption of combinations means the assumption of the tests you can perform over them.
I think there are four key types, and the first type you want to tell you is a very big thing.
Actually, how big is it?
Well, it's the discovery of one concrete connectivity of galaxies.
It's so massive that the light that goes through it is invented by the extreme gravitation of this connection.
And when you look very carefully, you're going to see the circles around the universe.
To not be vocal, it's just that single galaxies that have more than one million billion sun bodies.
It's absolutely how massive these systems can be.
But more than they have an additional particularity.
They are basically isolated systems, and if you want to think about them as a minor version of the entire universe.
"And on a lot of questions that can happen in us about the global world, for example, ""How does gravitation work?""
You can be able to answer by studying these systems.
Yes, that's what we said about a wonderful crowd.
The second type is that things are very cool.
Well, if you take a picture of the connectivity of galaxies and remove all the light that is released by stars, then this big, blue steep will remain.
It's a wrong coller.
What we see here is actually a rentigenic light.
So the question is, if it's not the galaxies that change this light?
And the answer will be a glass gas, a million degrees gas, it's actually plasma.
And the beginning of this garden can be found on the first side.
The extreme gravitation of these systems creates a gas flow and gives them a high speed, and the high speed, at the same time, is a high temperature.
That's the key sense, but it's just science.
There's also a lot of other particles of this plasma, which even though a head for us, the wall bluts us, and the wall sluts our understanding of the physics of the superficial goals.
The third is very little learning.
To tell you about this, I need to tell me about the troubling fact.
The majority of the Universe's mattery is not done from atoms.
You've manipulated the profile.
The majority is composed of something very dark that we call dark matter.
Dark material is something that isn't really good to interact, except for graffiti, and ultimately we pay to learn more about it.
If you're interested in physical timing, you're interested in what happens when we're talking about each other.
And dark material is not the exception.
How can we do that?
"If I answer this question, I'm going to answer something different, "What's going to happen if the collection of galaxies happen?""
Let's look at the picture.
We remember that the galaxic combinations are like the brightness of the universe, only a minor version.
They're preferably confronted with dark mathery, and this is what you see in this blue pump.
Red is a hot gas, and finally, you can see a lot of galaxies.
What happens here is the predicator of times in a very, very big machine.
And it's very important, because it means that very, very small effects that are hard to solve in the laboratory can connect and connect to something we can see in the nature.
Yes, it's really fun.
The reason why galaxic combinations can teach us about what is dark material, the reason why galaxic combinations can teach us about very little physics, just what they're too big.
Second thing: physics is very strange.
The worded age is actually going to run the head.
If there's something more strange, it should be dark energy.
If I put the floor in the air, I expect he to fly the fire.
But I don't expect that he's going to fly the carb with much more and more speed.
So cosmos also explain why the world is expanding.
They don't understand why it's amplified with the highest speed.
They don't come to this accelerated expansion of the name, and they call it dark energy.
And all of us want to understand more about it.
So one of the special questions that emerg, is how does dark energy influence the world in the most powerful machine?
And depending on its brain, the structure can buy its risks faster or faster.
And the problem of the universe is that it's terrible.
Let's look at the software simulation.
We need something to do it.
I want to think about this using an analogy.
To understand how the Titanic has fallen, the most important thing is not the model of the localization of every small car car car that has fallen out.
The most important thing is listening to two major parts.
So I can learn a lot of what about the world in the largest machine, like the largest parts of it, and these parts are the fusion of galaxies.
Lastly, I'm going to end my conversation, but you can feel little wrong.
I think I've started with how vital connectivity of galaxies, and I've shown some of these causes, but how do I actually use them?
So for a report, I want to work with Henry Ford when I asked him about cars.
"Every thing he said, ""If I asked people what they need, they would say they need faster horses."" The dream of our society is confronted with a very large number of problems."
And the solution of these problems is not obvious.
They're not the faster horses.
They need a huge number of scientific innovations.
Well, we need to be concerned, so we need to focus, but we also need to remember innovation, innovation, inspiration — that things come when we expand our field of vision when we do a step back when we look at disturbance.
And for me, the best way to do this is to learn the world around us. Thank you.
(Applause)
"So imagine yourself that you're at the street anywhere in America, and here comes to you a Japanese, and he says, "Do you see what is this block?""
"And you say, ""Look. Well, it's the Owl Street, and it's the Elm Street."
"It's two hundred, and it's two hundred."" He says, ""Well, what's this block?"" You say, ""You know, there's no name in the block."
"The voice has names; the blocks are just an unbelievable door between the street."" It comes out, a little bit distracted and frustrated."
"And now imagine yourself what you're standing on the street, you're going to Japan, you go to someone before you are, and you say, "Do you see what this street is called?""
"They answer, ""Oh, here's a block 17, and this is a block 16." And you're saying, ""Well, but how is it called this street?"" And they answer, ""How do you say, the street has no name."
There are names in the block.
Here's Google Maps. Here's the block 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.
All of these blocks are names, and the voice is just an unbelievable process between the blocks.
"And you said, ""It's good, but how do you know your home age?"" Anne says, ""Well, it's just, it's the eight area."
"There's a block 17, a house number one. You're saying, ""Laughter. But walking in the area, I noticed that women are not targeted at the same place."" And Anne says, ""It's not at the same place. Laughter is dependent on when women were built."
The house built in the first block is a house number one.
The house that was built to the second is a house number two.
"The third house is a house number three. It's simple. It's obvious."" That's, I really hope that we sometimes need to go on the other side of the ground to understand something we didn't even appreciate, and to realize that absolutely aggressive things are possible."
Here's, for example, in China, there are doctors who believe that their work is to maintain your health.
So every month when you don't suffer, you're wearing them, and if you don't suffer, you don't have to pay them because they didn't have to deal with their job, and they're rich when you're healthy, and not when you suffer.
"(Applause) All of the songs, ""Rise"" are a long time, the beginning of the musical phrase. Once, two four."
"One in South African music is the end of the phrase that the teacher said."
You can hear this not only in the words, but also in the way they say these songs, two, three, four, once.
And this map is also right.
(Laughter) So saying that in all the truth that we say about India, there's resistance that is also true.
So let's not forget that if you're at TED, or it's still going to be that independent of what close idea you have or you hear, it's also true.
Domo arigato gozaimashita.
