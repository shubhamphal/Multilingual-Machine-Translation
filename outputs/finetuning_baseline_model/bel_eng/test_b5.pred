To the end of this year, there's about a billion people on the planet who are actively using computers.
All of them realize what they're going to lose.
Because it's a terrible idea, but I think it's a serious consequences that you need to see.
It was the first thing I thought about this after I was posted in the journal Dick K. Miller, a science-tech journalist who died from cancer.
Miller asked his family and friends to write a written post published after his death.
That's what he wrote at the beginning.
"He said, ""Well, I died, and this is my last post in the blog."
"And then I asked my body just to look back from the knee, my family and my friends publish the prepared message I wrote as the first part of my blog from the active book."" Not surprisingly, like a journalist, My Miller's archives could be written better, and more accurate, the matter that today, all of the archives that are completely different from what was created by any previous generation."
Let's look at the roof of statistics.
Now, 48 hours of video are uploaded on YouTube every week.
There's 200 million minutes every day.
The middle user of Facebook creates 90 units of content per month.
If you think about your parents or your grandmother and your grandfather, they've actually created a few photos, or home videos, or a day living in a room.
But today, we create incredibly rich digital archives that will live in unknowable areas how long after our death.
I think it's creating a incredibly intriguing opportunity for technicians.
To be clear, I'm a journalist, not a technician, so I want to focus the core of what today and future will be like.
We've already seen some services that allow us to say what happens with our online profils and vaccines in the redesign after our death.
One of them, a few years ago, found me a chocolate in the New York restaurant box on Foursquare.
(Applause) Adam: Welcome.
Death: Adam?
A: Yeah.
Death: Death can kill you anywhere at any time, even in Arganik.
A: Who is that?
"Laughter: Go to ifidie.net, [""If I'm dying.net"] until it's too familiar."
(Laughter) A: Joyful, isn't true?
This service makes something pretty simple: you can create a message or a video that can be published on Facebook after your death.
The second service has the name of 1000 changes.
It allows you online to download the right thing and complete it with photos, videos and stories they can publish after your death.
But then it's just interesting.
Many of you, for example, heard about David Roy, who wanted to design how he could analyz more than 90,000 hours of home video.
I think with the enhancing of the ability of machines to understand human language and develop big data, it will be able to analyz the content throughout the life — images, photos, videos, messages in the blog — what we produce in many ways.
And I think it just happens, for our digital individuals, it will be able to continue to interact with the real world after our death, thanks to the expansion of the content we created, and the ability of technologies to give this sense.
Now we look at a couple of experiments.
There's a service that's my next Twitter, it's analyzing all your records in the Twitter, everything you've sent, and making predictions that you can write the next.
So as you can see, the outcome can be chemical.
Imagine something like this will look in 5, 10 or 20 years with the improvement of technical capabilities.
Doing a step forward, the MIT laboratory media works on robots that can interact as people.
And if the products could interact on the basis of the unique characteristics of each person, hundreds of thousands of the content that the person created for the whole life.
Lastly, remember the famous characters at the night of the US's election in 2008, when the CNN studio broadcasts the hipp-hop voice of Will.I.Am'a for an interview with Anderson Cooper.
And what if we could use this technology to predict how many of our hives in the hospital are really realistic, based on the content they created while they lived?
I think that's entirely possible, because the volume of data and technical skills that we create for their analysis are increased in the geometric прагtery.
So I think we all have to think if we want that to be real? And if that's what will mean to understand life and what else.
Thank you great.
(Applause)
The second exception is from the head of the government.
Unfortunately, the answer to these questions is right.
After that, you can do predictions and test them.
What do we know about complex systems?
It means that the literal system doesn't consist of their parts.
Where are economic networks?
We've been concentrated on my mass networks.
The quality of business is determined.
"How are they organized?"" They're self-organized?
These are companies that work in more than one country, and there are 43,000.
I'll explain by an analogy.
And more specifically, I want to talk about what is wrong in what we talk about love.
I don't know the follow you, but if I imagine this method, I see a cartoon scene — like this person, he's going to walk, never thought, he goes to a open person, and it's going to channel.
And I think that's just the way, because it's not going to accelerate.
It's sudden and uncontrollable.
It's something that happens with us without our permission.
I'm a writer and also a teacher of English, which means, talking about words, I'm going to live.
You can say, and I want to emphasize that many methods that we use to talk about love are even a major part of them have a problem.
So in love, we fall.
We're getting together.
We're growing.
We're suffering.
We remember from the fire.
Love makes us worth, and food makes us sick.
Our hearts look at, and then they're broken.
So our methophary causes someone's embarrassment to excess violence or disease.
(Laughter) Just like that.
And they position us as a number of unforgettable and safe devices.
"My love of them is ""smitten," which looks like the last word ""smite."" And if you look at the meaning of this word in the word — (Laughter) you see what it means and ""Laughter's time" and ""bow very embarrassed."" As the rule, I'm associated the word ""smite"" with a very special context, with Old West."
"So in one Book of Exception, there are 16 messages to the word ""Applause," which in the Bible is used for the resurrection of God."
(Laughter) We use the same word to talk about love that we interpret our six breakfasts. (Laughter)
Right?
How did it happen?
How did we come to the association of love with great pain and pain?
And why do we talk about this kind of good experience, how do we offer?
It's hard questions, but I have a few theory.
And to release this, I want to figure out on one concrete method that reflects love as barbarity.
When I first started to study Roman Love, I set these methods of humiliation over the universe.
In the history of the Western culture, there's a rich language that causes love for psychic disease.
Here's a few examples.
For the first time, I was 20 years old, and it was enough uncomfortable relationships from the beginning.
These were the relationships of disturbance in the first few years, so for me, it meant very high levels and low bottom.
I really remember one moment.
I was sitting on a bed in a hotel in South America, and I saw how my friend came out of the door.
It was known, it was almost entirely, we've done a night, and when we went back to our room, he left his things in the bag and he left the press.
If I don't remember the causes of this trouble, I'm very clearly reminded of how he saw his coming.
I was 22, it was my first bathroom in the country that grew up, and I was quite one.
It was a week to my journey home, and I knew the name of the city in which I was, and the name of the city I needed to find to go out, but I had no idea how to focus.
I didn't have a little gift and very little money, and I didn't know Spanish.
Someone more courageous than I could calculate this as a moment of chance, but I stopped.
I just sit there.
And then it grew up.
"But despite my pain, a little voice in my voice thought, ""Oh, it was dramatically."
"I really love the right way."" (Laughter) Because some part of me wanted to feel uncomfortable in love."
Now it sounds so strange for me, but at 22 years, I tried to have dramatic experiments, and at that moment, I was unbelievable, angry and devastated, and it's pretty strange, but I thought that it would even support the feelings of a guy who just had me left.
I think, at a kind of scale, I wanted to be a cool piece, because I thought it was love and work.
"It doesn't really be surprising, taking into account that Wikipedia has eight films, 14 songs, two albums and one novel called ""The Great Love."" After a half hour, he came back to our foot."
We've got sure.
But love someone in this way — like my success was entirely dependent on love, it wasn't really good for me or for him.
But I believe that this type of love is not very unusual.
Most of us feel like a little bit of pollination at the early stage of pollination.
In fact, there's a study that claims that it's normal, because neuryomy shows that stagnation and physical disturbance are not so easy to distinguish.
That's really that.
"This 1999 study uses blood tests to acknowledge that the rate of saturation of saturation is very similar to the rate of saturation in people with the diagnosis of ""excessive-cumptional disturbance.""
(Laughter) Well, the rate of serotonine is also associated with the syndrome of saisonally effective depression and depression.
So there's a few evidence that love is really linked to change of our mood and behavior.
And other studies suggest that most of the relationships start this way.
Researchers claim that a low level of serotinian is associated with an independent thinking about the object of love that reminds the feeling of someone who has been in your head.
And most of us feel like when they're love for the first time.
I decided that if my friends can't understand my devastating mountain, I don't need their friends.
So I stopped dealing with most of them.
And it was, for example, the most unexpected year in my life.
But I think I feel that being short is my job, because if I was short, I could be able to tell me how much I had to drive it.
And if I could show that, we would finally stay together.
It's a true value, because there's no universal rule that claims that a big paths leads to great reward, but we talk about love like that is true.
Our experience of love and biological and cultural.
Our biology says love is good, activating the collection of awards in our brain, and it says that love sounds when after stress or growth, neurological reward is divided.
In fact, you've heard about this, saying about neurosis, to spend the release like the stagnation from caffeine that I'm really complicated.
(Laughter) So our culture uses a language to mold and adapt this idea of love.
In this case, we talk about the symptoms of pain, dependence and dignity.
It's a pretty interesting bumeron of reverse connection.
Love is powerful and sometimes visible, and we show it through our words and stories, but then our words and stories prepar us to wait for a strong and visible love.
It's surprising that it's all happening in a culture that makes the life of my mother.
By being, we want initial and barbaric love, and we want to keep my life long.
It sounds horrible.
(Laughter) To imagine this, we need to change our culture or change our expectations.
Imagine we all would be less passionate in love.
If we were more confident, more open to new, more chocolate, but instead of love, we would have access to it.
I know that this requires a lot of things, but I'm not the first person who offers it.
"In the book ""The metafore we live"" the logists Mark Johnson and George Leckoff suggest a interesting solution to this film: we need to change our metafore."
They claim, and they can even act as leaders of our future things, as processed products.
John and Leckof will offer a new metafora for love: Love as a combined art.
I really love this way to talk about love.
Linguists say that the metaphars accept logics that, in essence, there's a way to see all the concepts or ideas that are in the metaphary.
John and Leckof say about everything that collaboration on art works produce: exilations, compromises, perseverance, general goals.
These ideas really correspond to our cultural involvement in long-term romance relationships, but they also work well in other kinds of relationships — short-term, casual, free, immortality — because these methods don't a lot more complex idea to experience someone else's love.
So if love is a common creative of art then love, it's an esthetic experience.
Love is unprecedented, creative love, love requires collaboration and discipline, frustrating and saving emotional emissions.
And love is composed of assoles and pain.
In fact, every love experience is different.
When I was young, I never thought that I couldn't accept everything I wanted to love.
When the fourth-year-old Julia first found that if the fourth-year-old Julia couldn't be without Romeo, who she had encountered four days ago, she wasn't frustrated or fascinated.
Where is she?
She wants to death.
Yeah?
And as an attack, at this moment of the pizza, the third of the five, Romeo doesn't survive.
He's alive, he's healthy, he's just released from the city.
I realize that North of the 16th century is similar to the modern North America, but when I read this pizza first, I was 14 years old, it had a sense for me.
Consider love as something I'm doing with someone I love, not just what happens with me without my control or consent, it gives my internal power.
But it's still hard.
Love at the last time is absolutely inevitable and devastating, and if I feel embarrassed, I need to remember that my job in these relationships is to talk with my partner about what I want to do together.
It's also easy.
But it's better than the second option in which love is barbarity.
It's a version of love that doesn't attract or lose any attention.
Instead, it requires trust to his partner and to mitigate the situation when it becomes hard to sound very simple, but in fact, revolutionary radioactive action.
Because you need to stop thinking about yourself and your purchases or losses in these relationships, and start thinking that you can offer.
"This version of love allows us to tell things like, ""Hey, we're not very good collaborators, and we don't have that for us.""
"Well, ""This relationships were the course I planned, but the same thing was amazing."" The total art is good to what he doesn't reduce or stop himself."
This version of love allows us to explain how the egg will look.
Thank you.
(Applause)
On the week of the 95th, I was another student with my friend who was traveling in a car from Provedans, which was in Rood Айланд, in Portland, which was in Argentina, 5000 miles.
You know how the jino goes when you're young and unemployed — we didn't walk on the master, along the bottom of the national park, national roads, by course, the longest way.
One week in South Dakota (after 3000 kilometers) I went back to my friend and asked me that I had been going to be around 3000 kilometers.
"What's this about the irroglyf that's all over the east?"
She went out in her eyes on the lab.
The gift that sits in the first place is just just now that's the expression of your body.
(Laughter) So I said to her, ""You know, these signs along the long time that's with the Chinese irroglyph."" She's going to stop on me for a few minutes, and then she's wearing a smile, because she finally understands it."
What I'm.
(Laughter) Here's he, this famous heroic place for pizza. (Laughter)
In the past five years, I thought a lot about these things — why we sometimes understand the signs of the voice, and how we treat ourselves when the sense happens, and what we all understand about the nature of the person.
Secondly, I've spent the past five years in discussions about the state of failure.
My career choice can seem to be incredibly, but there's a great benefit: lack of competition at work.
(Laughter) But most of us would be able to walk from our thinking about our ignorance, or they would try to never think about their disability.
Absolutely, we understand that.
We understand that sometimes every person in this room is felt.
We're people, we're going to be wrong. Well, please.
But when the question is about me, at this moment, my translations in this data, suddenly all the abstract view of the human need to fly the press, and I'm not able to imagine that I'm sorry.
What interesting is that we live just in this data time.
In them, we go to the meetings, we want to eat the vaccine, we're going to the bees and give our voice.
In practice, it seems that we all run through our lives in the way of belief that we always have a reason.
This seems to me a problem.
In my view, it's a problem like each of us, on a personal or professional level, and all of us together as a society.
What I want to tell today is the first point because we're looking at the sense of our right.
Secondly, it's why this approach is problematic.
And finally, I want to convince you that it's possible to come out of the shuttle of this sense, and if you're able to do it, it's the best of all of the ways that you look at marathon, wisdom and creativity that you can do.
Why do we look at the sense of our listening?
One of them is associated with the sense of ignorance.
Let you look at, maybe, because you're here. What are the emotions when you're not right?
Goodness. Incapacity.
Compassion. Good, fantastic, super.
Compassionate, with unconscious sense, with the sense of compassion, thank you, all of them are a file answer, but they answer another question.
You answer the question: "Every sense causes understanding that you're not right."
(Laughter) The understanding of your mind makes you feel like what it was said, and the entire spectrum, right?
For example, it can be a terrible feeling, whether it's a feeling of humiliation of understanding, or even a happy feeling like my stupid Chinese irroglyph.
But the condition of ignorance itself doesn't cause any other emotions.
For example, this is an analogy.
Do you remember the multiverse of the Moon Cunch company, where this mycer's flight is running all the time, but doesn't really tolerate the walking band?
Even in every episode of this series, the lion seems to go behind the flock, and this flock from the vast scale that's wrong because the flock is a birds, and it can fly.
But every time, the ship flows from the rocks now, it's like the flock.
What funny, especially if you're just six years old, is that it's too difficult for coffee.
He's simply going to walk until he's looking at the dollar and doesn't understand what he's going to see in the wind.
That's what he begins to fall.
If we're wrong, not if we understand what we're wrong, but then we're like this car, after the rock, but down.
You know, we've been afraid, we've already been able to deal with it, but we still feel confident on the ground.
I have to change what I've ever said.
There's a feeling in all the misconduct, it's a feeling of your right.
(Laughter) Because of this structural reason, we ever connect our rights to the sense.
I'm going to be blind.
And more importantly, we don't have a mechanism that would suggest if we're wrong until we know.
There's another reason why we're interested in this sense, it's more related to culture.
Imagine yourself a little early school.
You're a grandmother, and the teacher turns into the control, and one of them looks like that.
Now, it's not my.
(Laughter) Here's you in your school, and you know exactly what you think about one class who has received this note.
He's stupid and bad, he's never doing domestic works.
So until the 9-year-old age, you learned that, firstly, those who want to be let's be let's, let's go back, and secondly, to get a success in life, you can't never be forgiven.
We're learning these bad eyes much more human.
Most of us, and as I think, especially in this room, tend to take this lesson, it's going to be incredibly wonderful, perfect, healthy.
Or not, the executive director of finance, even astrophysic, is he also a super marathon?
(Laughter) So as you get, you're all such directors, astrophysics and marathonists.
Let it be.
The situation is worse only when we're doing that we've been wrong.
Because thinking in this way, when we do a mistake, we're saying that something isn't like us.
So we keep on our own, because so we feel reasonable, accountable, free and protected.
Let you tell you about the failure.
For a few years ago, the Beth Israel Dickonese hospital took a woman to operate.
This hospital is in Boston.
In this hospital, Harvard students are going to practice, and he's one of the best in the country.
This woman was taken and stuck in the operating room.
It was under the drug, the surgeon manipulates it, after he put it, and he's prosecuted in a post-operative room.
In fact, the operation went normal.
"A woman begins, she looks at her, and she says, ""Why's I not connected to that eye?"" And she's connected to that eye because the surgeon did a serious operation on her left foot, not right."
When he said about this discovery as a processor, he said something very interesting.
"And after the unknown time, the prosthetic surgeon felt that he worked on the right face."" (Laughter) Why I'm talking about it, because believing your sense of what you're at the right sight of something can be very dangerous.
This inner sense of our listening that we always feel is impossible to believe as the only sense of what really happens in the backworld.
And if we're just in our ways, we're looking at this forest, and we don't think about the intensity of our humiliation, we're doing stupidity about 760 million litres of oil in the West of Mexico, or the neutralization of the global economy.
It's a giant problem for practice.
But it's also a giant problem for society.
Think about a minute that means listening to your rights.
This means that your beliefs listen to distillate reality.
With this feeling, a strange problem is the explanation for all those people that are uncomfortable with you.
It seemed that most of us would explain for ourselves people with other view using the virus of wrong thinking.
The first thing we usually think if someone of us is wrong is that we believe they're not satisfied with the data question.
They don't have access to the information that you have, and if you share this information with them, they're going to go and they're going to your camp.
If it doesn't happen when we realize that they have the same facts with us, but they continue to remember, we move to the side of the other opinion — just what they are ideas.
(Laughter) They have all the tools they need, and they're not able to collect it.
And if it doesn't work if we understand that people who don't talk to us have the same facts and that they're too reasonable, we're going to the third opinion, they know the truth, but for their cruel purpose, the values transform this truth.
It's a disaster.
This privilege to take our right is not giving us to produce mistakes, especially if it's obligatory, and it makes us hard to stand up each other.
What I'm more likely to stand, I think it's tragic that this situation is absolutely happening with our human essence.
For example, we want to believe that our minds are those amazing disruptive stations that we can see and describe the exact world.
And we want all to look at the universe through the same angle, and we see exactly the same.
It's true, and if it was, the world would be incredibly boring.
The heart of our mind isn't what we can see the world he's.
He is that we can see the world not like it.
We can have a lot of memories about the future, and we can imagine ourselves that we're other people in other places.
It's just because everyone sees the clothes differently, we can observe the same angle of the middle sky and see it, and that, and that, and that.
It's just because we're wrong.
For 1200 years before Decart invent his famous word, "I think and think there is," a friend named Saint Augustine wrote, "fallor ergo sum" — "I think and know there."
Augustin realized that the fact of our compassion is not the invisible effect of the human system, nothing to prevent or eliminate.
It's the foundation of our human beings.
Because we don't be God, we don't know what happens in this world.
Unlike other animals, we're really trying to catch this world.
I think it's a short distance, it's a root and a result of all our productivity and creative imagination.
Let's, for different reasons, I started to listen to a lot of publishers of this American life on the public radio.
I heard, heard, and I started to feel that all the conversations were about something wrong.
"In the first time, I thought, "I was happy.
Now, I'm always looking at ignorance.
"It seems to me everywhere."" There were the Greeks blessings.
But for a few months, I've felt that I was able to get an interview in the script of the Irish Voice program.
I shared this opinion with them, and he said to me, "It's really that."
He showed that the creator of the program even joke that in every release is the same topic.
"And she's going to say, ""I thought that happens, and it's really different."" What's interesting," said Aaron Glas, "Every thing we need that information."
We need those moments of failure and changes of ignorance to survive these stories."" What are all of us, authors, as listeners or readers, is that stories of satisfaction.
We're going to change this story, creative steps and unconscious scores.
What is about our stories, we're going to be afraid.
But you know that our stories are like, because our lives are like that.
We think that's going to happen, and it's really different.
George Bush thought it would attack Iraq, and there would be mass destruction weapon, liberating people and preserving the Democracy of the Middle East.
And finally, it happened differently.
Also, José Mubarak thought it would be a digater of Egypt to the end of his life until it's stagnating and dispersed, and then he could transform his own power to his son.
And finally, it happened differently.
Maybe and you ever thought you would stay and join the cool school, go back to your home city and find out how many kids together.
And finally, it happened differently.
I have to admit that I thought I would write the latest book about something that doesn't happen to anyone, for readers that would never be.
And finally, it happened differently.
(Laughter) That's the same life.
We're developing amazing ideas about a strange world, sometimes it's the best way, sometimes not. And the world is dominated and fascinated by us.
Don't worry, but there's all this conference like a memory of our compassion.
We've spent a whole week to talk about innovation, acceleration and transformation, but you know why we need these innovations, accelerations and transformation?
Because the foundation of ideas that were really interesting and had the opportunity to change the world, see TED in 1998, what is there.
(Laughter) Have you not done this? (Laughter)
Where's my ascendent shirt, Chris? (Laughter)
(Applause) And we're here again.
And it's going to continue.
We'll find another idea.
We're talking about another story.
We're going to participate in another conference.
Today's topic, as you've heard seven million times, is how to find beauty again.
So if you really want to find the beauty again, then go through the border of this little bit and the terrible space of your right and look at each other, and also look at the infinity, the integrity and the mystery of the universe, and let you say, "And I don't know.
"I can be sorry."" Thank you.
(Applause) Thank you all. (Applause)
Five October 1990 a person named El-Saide Nasar entered the hotel in Manhattan, and he lost Mary Khan, the leader of the Hungarian Defense League.
For the first time, Nazara declared the unknown in the battle, but when he and his collaborators were released for other crimes, he and his collaborators started planning attacks on a number of New York celebrities, including panels, crafts and the United Nations's organization's headquarters.
Well, these plans were done by the FBI's infirmator.
But unfortunately, the crash in 1993 in the World Trade Center has failed.
In the result, Nazara was accused of participating in the ability.
El-Saide Nasar is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983 in a family of a Japanese engineer and a grandmother of Americans, teachers of early classes, and my parents were trying to make my childhood happy.
But when I was seven years old, the communication in our family began to change.
My father showed me the side of the Islam that little people had to see, including even most Muslims.
My experience shows that when people know each other, they're not enough enough time to realize that in fact, we all want one and the same.
But in every religion, every generation, there's a little percent of people who really accept their beliefs that feel the need to use any resources to enable others to live according to their rules.
A few months later, my father sent me, and he told me that a few last weekend, he went with his friends to London Island for coach.
He said I would go with them next morning.
We went to the Calverton Street, which was the FBI.
At that day, my last shot ran into a small arrangement lamp around the mix, and, to all-round surprise, and especially my, the whole dimension fell down the pollination.
"My daughter came back to friends and said in Arabic, ""Iбн Abu."" Who's father, like a son."
They've all really distinguished this future, but only a few years later, I realized her sense completely.
They looked at me like the same killer that my father was.
As a result, those people were asked for the fire of a truck, which was chargeed by families of carbon explosions in the underground park of the North Wall of the World Trade Center, and that explosion led to six people, and the injuries received more than one thousand.
These were the men that I was doing.
"These people I called ""am," which means ""Allah.""
Every time I started to feel comfortable at one place, I've got time to introduce things and move to another city.
When I was always a new person in the class, I was often a human minority.
I learned to judge people on the basis of cases, like religion or race.
What opened my eyes?
The first event that ended with this image of thinking occurred during the 2000 President's elections.
Through the preparatory program, I could participate in the National Assembly of People in Philadelphia.
The members of our group introduced the different plates of society.
One time, close to the end of the journey, I found that one of my new friends was bitter.
I've never had friends of the Hebrew English, and I really said, I was proud of that I was proud of the barrier, in the imperativity I believed almost all my life.
And the second turning point was the summer building in Bush Gardens, and it was a park of attractions.
There I saw people of the most different beliefs and cultures, and this experience was fundamental in building my personality.
The part of the cruelty that I was born in childhood, was the feeling of compassion for others, and for me, it's not natural to go to other good people as I wanted to stand to me.
This feeling allowed me to compare stereotypes that taught me in childhood with life experience.
And then the Daily Show was, and every night, John Stuart asked me to be honest with myself after my own fascination and helped me to realize that race, religion or sexual attention didn't have anything common with personal characteristics.
In many ways, he changed me to the father I needed then.
The inspiration often comes from where you really don't expect it, now I'm well aware that the graffiti impacted on my world look more positive than my father-extremist.
One time, I talked with my mother about how I started to change my vision, and she told me something that I'm going to keep my whole life in my heart.
At that moment, I realized how much negative energy is needed to maintain this uncertainty inside me.
Because Abraham is not my true name.
I took him when my family decided to open relationships with my parents and start a new life.
Why do I open my person and potentially threaten me?
Well, it's simple.
Instead of this, I use my experience in fighting the terrorism, in fighting the fanatism.
I'm doing this for victims of therapy and their parents, for terrible pain and losses that caused their part of the therapy.
In memory of the victims of the terrorism, I'm talking to these misconditional actions, and I ask my father's actions.
I'm here as a proof that violence is not an unconscious part of religion or race, and that the son is not obligated to support his father's path.
I'm not my father.
Thank you. (Applause) Thank you all. (Applause) Thank you all. (Applause) Thank you very much. (Applause)
But it can't be so.
I'm the one who love chocolate bees.
I learned that every thing through these 30-year-old tests.
This is the idea of my experiment when I've done a picture every day a month.
I didn't ever like the beauty.
She's horrible.
They're actually the biggest.
(Applause)
I've amazing to be born in a country that is the best place in the world to be woman.
In 1975, when I was seven years old, women in Iceland went to a vacant.
At that day, they didn't work, independent of whether they had a job or just their home work.
They went to the Reckivic center, 90 percent of women were involved, and they've been silent and solidly asked about gender.
Nothing worked in Iceland on that day, because nothing works when women don't have.
(Applause) For five years, Iceland had the ability to become the first country in the world that a democratic way called a woman as president.
I'll never forget that day when the President Higgs, known in our name, went on the balkon of his house, my mother, together with my daughter, after his victory.
(Applause) She became an amazing model to transform me and everyone who grew up at that time, including kids.
She often told her a story about a guy who came to her after a few minutes on his post, and he said, "And the kids can also be leaders when they grow?" (Laughter) The roll models are really important, but even with the strong perspective to change that I'm very confident when I've proposed to talk to the president's post, my first response was, ""Who's I going to go to this post?"
Who's I like to be president?"" It's true that women are less likely to stress on the position than men.
A study conducted in the U.S. in 2011, showed that 62 percent of the men looked at their appointment at the president, but only 45 percent of the women.
We see a breakdown in 16 percent, and it's the same breakdown that happened for decades ago.
It's true shame, because I'm confident that this world needs women of leadership and better leadership in general.
So my decision to ballate finally came to what I felt needed to make my imagination, even without any political experiments, to go ahead and to try to participate in creating a world that will have a sense to dissip three for our kids, where we really allow our kids, and girls to achieve everything they want.
It was the journey of my entire life.
It was amazing.
The journey started with 20 patients.
After the qualification, the number was connected to nine candidates, and finally the race came to us four, three men and me.
(Applause) But it's not a drama.
Maybe you think there are drama in the United States, but I can — (Laughter) I can say that we're not worse in Iceland.
In the first century, the president who was in the past 20 years, showed that it wasn't going to be labelled, it's going to be, and it led to that number of candidates.
And then he thought when our Prime Minister was able to deliver because of the very famous Panama documents that he and his family were involved.
There was a popular protest in Iceland, because the president felt that the country needed a recognized leader.
And a few days later, the connection with his wife and her family was also left in Panama documents, and he left the race again.
Before he was sitting, he explained what he did this, because there are two qualified men who can be his year-old transformers on the table.
So nine years later, 45 days after the choice, it seemed not too good for me.
I didn't even pick a place in the journal chart.
According to a survey, I had one percent, but all the same thing, it was the highest position among women who were.
It's going to change to say that I've given the example of all the suggestions to get my place behind the steel and get on the TV because the TV decided to include only customers with a minimum of 2,5 percent of the voice in the first TV.
At the day of these tests, I've learned that I would join there together with three men, and during the era, I found that I received 2.5 percent in the day of the first debate.
(Applause) And about problems.
The fundamental problems that were forced to meet and do on this path were related to media, support and play.
Let's start with media.
Some claim that sex has no meaning for media and politics.
I can't agree.
I've been trying to get more accessible and more efficient time in the media.
In fact, the leading candidate came out in the public media 87 times a few months before the election, while I came there 31 times.
And I don't say that media do this.
I think there's a source in an unknown page, because in the media, more than everywhere, there's a known and unknown page, and we need to speak about it if we want to reduce.
When I finally got access to TV, the first question said, "Do you want to remove your application?"" It was a hard question.
Now, with one to 2,5 percent of the voice in the audience, you can understand it.
But the media is really important, and every time I've been on TV, we've seen and experienced an increase in interviews, so I don't know how important it is, and why we need to talk about it.
I've never had one of the four final candidates in the first place.
I've always been left by questions that looked at all the rest of the candidates, and by the light of the choices.
I've been confronted with this, but I'll tell you a computer of the island media.
There wasn't almost any commentary in the case of my waves or my hair.
(Applause) Let them be written.
But there's another very important experience.
I was like a independent candidate, without any political party or support.
This lack of experience and access to resources, perhaps, has gone through our company, but also allowed it to introduce new and do politics differently.
Our company was positive, and so we probably changed the tone of choices for others.
I'm in this source of less time on TV, because I wanted to show attention to another printer.
If access to media was extremely complex, we started our own information resources.
I had online interviews on Facebook, and I was able to answer every question of the selected.
All the questions that we received together with the answers, we were released to open access to Facebook because we believed the importance of access when you wanted to install a computer.
When I found a problem to pay attention to young players, I started using Snapchat.
Prayer showed me how to do this, and I used every filter in Snapchat during the last part of the company.
I really had a lot of humors and room, because I'm a prophet here.
But thanks to this, we have increased the number of favorers among the population.
It's true that it's possible to know the company and in a different way.
Unfortunately, we can't talk about politics and not remember money.
It's true, but it's true, and we had less financial resources than in other customers.
Maybe, the source was partly that, in my view, the time was unbelievable to look at financial support.
And maybe I wanted to do more with less costs.
Some say that it's very sexy.
But even with the lost media and financial resources, and only with a business, but a wonderful company, we had to appreciate all the day of the choices when the first numbers came.
I felt myself like you can see on the picture.
(Laughter) Based on the first data, I went together with a leading customer.
(Applause voice) Well, too early, because I couldn't win, but I took the second place, and we went a long way from one point to almost a third part of the voice, we took the question with unprecedented breakdown, the result was 10 percent higher than the last survey.
Because of this, some of me have fascinated the true winner of the choices, and many people have forced me to fight again.
But in fact, I've been forced to reinforce the knowledge that I've earned a more proportionally higher percentage of support from the city, and a large number of people taught me to beat my daughter in 2040.
(Applause) Now she was 13, and she had never been on TV.
But on the day of the choice, I've ever seen her on TV, she was smart, confident, she was honest and supported her mother.
Maybe it was the most important moment of my company.
(Applause) But there was another.
At the time of the pollination, the girls of the disease had seen my poster at the automotive stop, and they wanted to put it.
Author: Oh!
This idea is for me already a victory.
We can achieve everything we see.
The sort of fear and problems.
(Applause) Women's leadership needs, and it's time for women to fight, if it's the post of a gender or president.
"And I've also managed to imagine your family magazine ""New Yorker."" I've seen a new title: "The real sense of honestness."" (Applause clicks) Maybe it's my most popular title, because women are too often fighting for the profit of emotional capital as I call him, but I know with the own sense that we're going to win only when we do this."
(Applause) And we need to use it more.
On the day of the choice, we celebrate, we've been overwhelmed, because we felt that.
It's absolutely impossible to get this post.
You just need to go to this, and you, your family and friends, all who are going to work with you if you're doing good, you're going to grow higher than what you've spent the past.
We've done good time, and I'm rich to learn during this journey, more than I can tell you today.
But be sure, it was a hard job.
And I didn't sleep in those months.
And the compassion and compassion came out to not sit, and I finally realized what I knew on the day of one point: you can only listen to yourself and act in harm of this inner voice.
So as my good sister says, you can bed your intuition, but intuition never bed you.
I also want to emphasize, and you all know that, in all your journey, the key thing is your team.
People thought that they share your values and your vision, but they're different.
For me, this is the form of success, and I'm happy to a wonderful man who today is here, a wonderful family ... (Applause) and great friends, we've come up as entrepreneurs in political arena, and we've done something, in terms of people, impossible.
In fact, the chief public-related specialist said to how I decided that would be good if I get 7 percent.
I looked at his point of view, because I had, he had a reason, and he found my opinion on a valuable experience.
But on one day, I decided to show that he was embarrassed.
It's really important to know it, because I really was very small and practically working like people like me.
We're never able to achieve a lot when we're going to forget the question about ourselves.
I think there are two very important points in this matter: attack yourself with people and things that saturate you, but not less important if not more, have the ability to look at people and actions that pick your energy, including wonderful bloggers and commentators.
So I was fully supported by others, and I decided not to focus attention to the abrases, partly because my nerve was lost all that time.
When I lost an energy at a moment — and it happened time from time, because it was not easy — I looked at my thoughts about my causes to beat, and not just like, but by my rules.
I called our 4G campaign, where G letter means island words.
The first of them is Gagn. I wanted to do a tool, to be critical, and I wanted that leadership concept as a service was the center of our work during the first campaign.
The second word is "Laughter" or joy.
I decided to do this journey.
It could take a lot of them, regardless of whether it was reached the point of recognition.
And I've done all the suggestions to inspire others.
The third word is Gagnese, and I was open for all questions.
I didn't know what I could learn on Facebook or on our websites.
I think when you choose a president, you deserve answers to your questions.
A little less important word of a teacher who doesn't need to explain in this room, we're a big company according to Girlpower, the female power.
(Applause voice) I'm incredibly happy that I found the ability to fight to risk the right, but that's a lot of success.
I can't say that it was simple, but I'm confident, and I think all of my team would agree, I was worth it.
Thank you.
(Applause) Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)
Peter Mitchell: I don't leave you anymore. Hall Thomas: What good listeners. PM: I can't leave you, I don't notice,
That maybe everyone in this field is willing to go to Iceland and vote for you.
We're sure if we're going to have the right to voice there, but there's something we can take in Iceland like before, it's an inspiration.
I think it's pretty old to remember 1975 when women of Iceland went out on the street, and it really became a big factor when women started movement.
You've been invited to this event before. Let's read the picture to imagine yourself how it looked like the country that went into the cup.
And you can't know, because the American media didn't report about it, but the island women went back to the street, right?
HC: Yeah. PM: Can you tell us about this?
HC: 41 years after that evening, we can be considered the best place in the world to be woman, but our job wasn't finished.
So in the book 14,38, women in Iceland left work, because just then they paid their daily income.
(Applause) The truth was that young girls and boys were involved in a lot more than before, because it was time to solve the gap in the pay.
PM: I'm not going to ask Hall now about her future plans, but I'm going to say that you're going to have a great goodwill arm if you're going to do that again.
Thank you, Hall.
HC: Thank you all.
(Applause)
In fact, I tried to think about my career from the time I left the White House, and the best example I had — the paper in The New Yorker for a few years ago.
"The little boy who looks at his father says, ""When I grow up, I want to be ex-president."" (Laughter) I'm very happy as a president, because I had access that little people in the world had ever to meet people around the world."
They introduce these rules to make sure women are usually able to take their own positions in comparison with men in God's eyes.
So they published a statement that, in fact, moves women to be holy, clergy, clergy, clergy in the church, or clergy in the arm, when a woman learns in a class in South Boston seminar, she can't teach when a boy in the room, because you can find the top of the Bible, and in the Bible more than 30,000 pages, where it's said that women don't have to learn a man, and that.
But the key thing is that books are wrong interpreted to keep men in a higher position.
Why should I pay them the same reward for the end of the same job?
In the U.S., for example, we had a huge increase in the abrasion of poor, mainly dark people and minorities that were planted in turms.
Now, 7,3 people from 1,000 are in prison.
It's a simulation.
Since I left the White House, there was 800 percent of dark women in the dark room.
We're one of the few countries on Earth that have a moderate generation, which is a developed country.
We're now in California, and I've learned a few days that California had spent four billion dollars to judge 13 people for a mortal death.
One of them is the abrasion of the clerical organs.
Sometimes, in more extreme cases, it's going to take a tattoo so that a girl can't go.
And then, when she gets married, the same race eliminates abortion so that you can have sex.
It's not the truth, it's against the law.
In Egypt, for example, 91 percent of all women living in Egypt today were sexually eliminated.
In some countries, it's more than 98 percent of women who are obsessed to be successful.
It's a terrible disaster for all women living in those countries.
There's another very serious thing where a family with a wrong explanation, there's nothing in Korea that's mysterious, it's going to kill a girl from his family when she was frustrated or when she gets married or sometimes, even if she's wearing it.
It's going to be a family member, so the family becomes a murderer when a girl causes the so called shame in the family.
Not so long, an AN analysis was conducted in Egypt, and he showed that 75 percent of these deaths were taken by parents, kids or brothers, 25 percent of the deaths were conducted by women.
The other problem that exists in the world in dealing with women is slavery or humiliation as it's now called.
About 12.5 million people were sold to the New World in the 19th and 18th century.
30 million people live today in slavery.
The U.S. State Department has to pay a debt every year, and the U.S. Department says, over international limits every year, 80 percent of those reported — women who suffer sexual slavery.
In the United States, just at that moment, 60,000 people live under gins or slavery.
Atlanta, Georgia, where I'm Central Carter, and where I'm studying at the University of America, between 200 and 300 women, people.
It's the number one place in the country because of that.
There's also a lot of passengers in Atlantic.
If a boss wants to buy a girl who has the benefits they can do that for 1,000 dollars.
A white girl who's going to get a average boss of the bagel in the Atlantic can pay about $ 35,000 of the job.
The sex island in Atlanta, Georgia,
This leads to one of the worst problems, women buy and sold in all the countries of the world.
Sweden has a good approach to this.
For 15 to 20 years ago, Sweden decided to change the law, and women are not more examined by the law when they're in sexual slavery, but the owners of bars, centrors and — (Applause) — the Constitution went to decline.
In the United States,
One man who had 25 women arrested in the United States.
Canada, Ireland, I said, Sweden, France and other countries move now to this.
It's another thing that can be done.
We have two big instituts in the country, our arm and a great university system.
The arm is analyzed.
The last report I received said that happened in the military was 26,000.
Only 3000, a little more than one percent, and the result is that a team of any organization is a car like my underwater ship, or a crew in the Maritime Sand, a team has the right to solve a crime accident, and, of course, the last thing they want to do that under their mandating, they don't do that.
This law needs to be changed.
The Justice Department says that on the campus's campus is done because through the campus system, when they violate someone, but when they're located in the campus.
They don't be examined.
It's what happens in our society.
When I was president, the difference was 39 percent.
So we've achieved a certain prag, and so long — (Applause) (Laughter) — but in the past 15 years, there was only about 23 or 24 percent of the difference in the past 15 years.
That's what happens today.
If you take 500 companies, there's 23 of their creative women, 500, and these leaders, I'll tell you, they're going to earn in the middle less than the rest of the leaders.
That's what happens in our country.
There's another problem with the United States: we're the most powerful country on Earth.
We've been at the end of the War just since the Second World War.
Some of our soldiers were at the place of walking.
And together, we've been running over the voice, putting bomb on people.
Sometimes, though, we're going to have wireless.
We were in a war with 25 different countries or more after the Second World War.
For four years, I'm not going to say what we didn't drive — (Applause) — we didn't kill any bomb, we didn't kill.
But in any case, those things, turned into violence and wrong interpretation of holy books, are the fundamental causes of violence over women.
There's another fundamentally example, Agol, to plame men.
(Applause) That's the truth.
A common man who can say, it's very similar to that when I was young, when compassion and diversity were harmonized.
But over that time, there was a lot of white people who didn't think that the discovery was good, but they were afraid because they used the privileges of unique access to the ships of accessible, best schools and all the rest, and it's the same thing that is today, because the usual man, actually, is the same.
"And even when they say, ""I'm against disclosure, they're using a privileged situation."
What's the fundamental thing we need to do today?
I would say, the best thing we could do for women from powerful countries like this, and where you're born, Europe, and how long you have the impact to take responsibility to ourselves to be more translated to end the racism discrimination around the world.
But I hope that after this conference, women translate their men, about the violence in college campus and in the military and government, and in the future on the job market, we need to protect their kids and expectations.
I have 12 kids, four kids and 10 truthers, I often think about them, and about the bitter situation, not just if they lived in Egypt to have equal rights, and I hope you all get to me to be championship for women around the world, and protect their rights to human beings.
Thank you great.
(Applause)
When I was a student here in Oxford in the 1970s, the future of the world seemed dead.
The growth of the population was not to stop.
The world's voice was safe.
Cancer epidemic caused by chemicals in the environment was trying to cut our lives.
The cold rain fell over the forest.
The oil ended, and the nuclear system of the channel would end up.
With me, my average life has increased to 30%.
The 10-year maturity changed to two thirds.
The production of food for the population grew up for a third.
The number of crops on the chart distorses the death of the population, and this chart shows the GDP on the population.
And with other words, you need to understand how ideas come to sex.
I want you to imagine how we went from creating these projects to create these.
Lastly, there were some changes, but the performance changed more than the skelet in the same time.
It's a successful phenomenon, but it's true.
When the project is planted in five years.
And more than that, with a combination of different ideas, plastic ideas, laser ideas, transistor ideas.
They were connected to this technology.
And it's a computer, that's a collective technology that affects me, because I think it's the key to understand what happens in the world.
My body is also the collection of ideas: the idea of the cool cells, the idea of the brain cells, the idea of the black cell.
They gathered together.
How does evolution do something interdependent or unified?
It's using a slow conversation.
One means another to survive.
In fact, with a room conversation, it's possible to get the person in the legacy of mutation in different lines.
Well, sex allows people to solve genetic innovations of all kinds.
It's not about personal nature.
What process has the same effect in cultural revolution that sex has in biological evolution?
I think the answer is a change, the usual change one thing to another.
It's the unique human risk.
Wild animals don't do that.
It can be this assexual culture.
In printing, the box is a culture.
They learn one of the traditions that are translated from parents to our kids.
Shampens games have different cultures in different games.
There's no change of ideas between them.
Why did the change increase life standards?
The statement came from David Ricardo in 1817.
I write his opinion in the version of the Camenn Age, which he also explained in terms of trade between countries.
Adam produces a wild in four hours and a laser in three hours.
The oz produce a wild in one hour and a syringe in two hours.
It's better than Adam in a product and a siker, and wonders.
And I'm unhappy Adam.
He can do his own wonders and tears.
Adam and Oz were self-oriented by their time.
If you start first, you need to go to the village.
How much is this sun? Have you spent a lot of time.
How much is you going to work for a hour of nightlight to read if you have a average income in UK?
It was done for me by other people.
How exact person did it?
Thirty? Thirty? Thirty?
You know, I think, millions.
And so society works.
That's what we've achieved as biological.
In ancient times, when you were rich, people literally worked on you.
498 people every day got her vaccine.
In fact, there are other animals that work each other.
Laughter is a classic example.
Carlaella is responsible for growth.
(Applause) When did that happen?
But I don't have any evidence of that.
And the beauty of this system is that it's useful for both eyes.
And a man knows that he doesn't need to fall to make a career.
They were a high cooperative knowledge.
They were a very reasonable knowledge.
But there's no evidence that they had a stable part of their work.
There's no evidence of collection among women.
It seems that women ran together with men.
There's also no evidence of change between groups, because it's one of the parts of the neuronal projects, the devices they've done are always made from local materials.
For example, there's a place in Costa Rica where local non-andertal devices were invented.
They are always made from local cream.
If a person started to change the topics by this way, it's proof of that they were changed between groups.
Sandal is 10 times older than farming.
And the early evidence of this is discovered for some 80-120,000 years ago in Africa, where we see that obsession, mermer and other things are going to get great distances from Ethiopia.
The cancer, as it was invented here, also in Oxford, went 200 miles of mycorrhide carbon from the Mediterranean Algeria.
And this is the evidence that groups of people started to change.
And that led to specialization.
What happens if you limit people from change, from the ability to change and specialize?
The evidence is that it doesn't only stop the technical prag, but it can even turn it into the opposite way.
The example of this is Tasmania.
The teams were isolated.
Let's be back to discover and look at ourselves, not only who did that and for whom, but who knew how to do it?
Nobody, literally nobody.
"I'm actually the famous eses of Leonard Ridd, an economist in the 1950s called ""I, Solovik," in which he wrote how the olovic is produced, and nobody knows how to do olovic, because people in the collection don't know how to get a graph, and they don't know how to plant and all of this plant."
What we did in the modern society, the way of change and specialization, we created the opportunity to do things we even don't understand.
It's not the same thing in the language.
Now, because I'm not interested in the debate about intelligence level, or they have some groups more IQ than other groups.
It's absolutely not meaningful.
In the community, it's important how good people transform their ideas, and how good they cooperate, not how smart one person is.
We created a collective brain.
We're just the nodes in the network.
We're the neurons of this brain.
Absolutely the idea, the encounter and the mix of the idea is one of the directive technical progress, step by step.
There's no matter what strange things happen.
In the future, as we move forward, terrible things happen.
It's war, depression, natural catolicisms.
Strange things happen in this century, I'm absolutely confident.
Thank you.
(Applause)
