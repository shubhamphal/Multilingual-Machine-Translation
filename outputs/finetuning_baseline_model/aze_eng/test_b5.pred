I'm going to talk about unexpected discovery today.
Now, I'm working in solar technology industry.
And my little beginning point is to bring ourselves into force, and that's the same.
So, for that, he looked at different sources.
It's just a little video about what we're doing.
Yeah, just a minute.
It's a little bit of time.
(Laughter) We're just going to pass this part — I'm going to pass over the part of the video — (Laughter)
Not. (Laughter) (Laughter)
(Music) It's not ... (Laughter)
Well. (Laughter)
Sun technology.
Oh, was my time finished?
Well. Thank you very much.
(Applause)
So I'd like to look at what you're doing.
And we're going to go back to it a few minutes later, and I hope if you learn to control your body slightly, it will change your life very seriously.
We're very interested in the language of the body, especially the body of others takes our attention.
There are different things that concern us: (Laughter) something simple like unconsciousness or smile, unbelievable perspective or worrying expectation, or even tightness of the hand.
Western: Now they're coming to a 10-year-old house.
It's a lucky policing that takes the hands of the President of the U.S.
We're looking forward. We're collecting ourselves.
We're flying.
We're trying to be invisible for someone around us.
As you see, animals and humans do the same things.
And when you're confronted with the force and the courage, it's happening.
And when we're sure, we're actually able to complete the scores of others.
So if someone uses power to us, we're trying to collect, and we're not able to replicate his frequencies.
Instead, we're going to follow his power.
I've seen that MBA students show a lot of powers.
Some of them take themselves as a leader, and when they go into the classroom, they go in the right middle of the garage, they're still going to their place before they start a lesson.
When they go, they're going to place almost two people.
They raise their lives in this way.
I've done a few results for myself.
First, you think it's not going to be surprised.
It's calculated that it's dependent on gravity.
So women depend more of this blood than men.
Women usually feel less vulnerable than men, and it's not surprising.
And this is very important for the students of MBA, because it affects their education prices.
Business schools are always fighting gender differences.
People and women, who are in the same level, get different prices at the end of the course, and it seems to be related to the involvement.
And I started to think about myself, and we'll see that those who come in this way are more active in the classroom.
So if they show these videos, if they want themselves to take these kinds of apps, they'll be more active at school?
So if we show ourselves strong for a short time, can we feel stronger as a result of our behavior change?
Now, we know that our winds and architecture defines thinking and parts of others about us, and there's a lot of points.
But the question that really affects us is that the essence and the techniques don't impact ourselves.
So it's real in both ways.
It's also about power.
And when we feel strong and confident, we're fruit of the forces that show more force, but when we try to become strong, we feel strong.
What do I mean when I'm thinking about the power feeling?
I talk about thinking and particles, as well as physiological things that form them, and I think they're these hormones. I'm learning the hormones.
What does it differentiate the minds of weak and weak?
But only 60 percent of those in the power position, that's a very important difference.
And that's what we're discovered in testosterone.
As I went out, I grew up with 20% of the test of those who passed the experience of force, and in others, it was a 10% reduction.
Almost two minutes, these changes are going to happen.
And what happens in the cortic is these.
It's about 25 percent in the corticosis of those in the force position, and in others, it's about 15 percent in the body.
Almost two minutes, these harmonial changes accelerate our brain to feel more hard, more comfortable, or stressed and hot.
These particles are familiar with us all, right?
So our body's language defines how we think and feel about ourselves, so it's not only for others.
And the other body can change our minds.
And the next question that we're interested is that we're able to change our lives in a significant degree of a few minutes of force position.
This is a two-minute experiment that started in the labor.
Can it be applied in real life?
Of course, that's what we're really interested.
In fact, these places can be used to be used to calculate the conditions that create social danger.
Are we usually measured at the floor?
This is the back of the food table for new things.
It's a school meeting for some.
It's an interview for some, or the answer, or the work interview.
We thought that most of you would be interested in a product interview, because it's a lot of you're experienced.
So we published our findings, media interviewed them across, and the jusrnalists said, "Do we do this when we go to a job interview?"
(Laughter) Of course, we rejected this idea. No! Of course, we didn't predict it.
You don't do this.
It's not with your other people.
It's important to communicate with yourself.
What do you do before you start the interview? Usually?
You're sitting. You look at iPhone or Android.
You're looking at your records, you're crying, you're collecting yourself. And actually, what you're going to do is that, as you're sitting on the foot. Take it for two minutes.
That was what we wanted to cook.
They went to the laboratory, and they went to a very intense work interview after they received power and power points.
Five minutes interview was taken into a video.
They were taught to use them by an unverbally tool to prevent the effects of those who calculated the activity. They looked like this.
In five minutes, looking at an emotional face, it's more cool than to keep a question.
Nobody likes it.
This is Marian LaFrance called this, "Stop in social battle."" And it increases the level of cortic.
So we took them from a interview to see things.
And then we've shown four of these pictures to the coders.
They were not aware of our expectations.
"They were not aware of what they've taken."" After they looked at the video records, they showed people who had a high-power position, saying, "We want to take them."
"We don't want to take them into work.
"And the ancestors are more positive."" What does this effect?"
It's not because of them.
It's depending on what they're going on.
And we looked at the other indicators of them, for example, how much are the scores right?
What are the benefits?
There was no difference from those indicators.
That's not what's the main impact.
People just showed their real surface.
So they show themselves.
You don't imagine their ideas, they show themselves.
It really affects this factor.
"And when I say to people that our body's thinking, our behavior, our behavior can change our results, ""Is that not a little?"" And I'm."
I'm going to say, you're imitation until it comes to the reality.
"""I'm not so."
I don't want to realize something and feel cool.
I don't want to be a fraud.
"I don't want to be where I'm invisible.""
"I'll understand these words very well. I'd like to tell you a little story about the feeling of ""I'm not my place.""
When I was 19, I had a very severe car crash.
It's taken out of a car.
I turned out there a few times.
I played in the rehabilitation department, I had to leave the college, and I told me that I was down to two indicators of the IQ level. It was very painful for me.
I've found my IQ because I've been recognized as a intelligent and unwanted kid from childhood.
Because I was released from college, I tried to return.
"They said to me, ""You don't have to end the college."
"It's a lot of things you can eat, but college industry isn't."" They said, I've started to fight that you have the key features that you have, because I think it's a stroke, nothing doesn't make you weak as you get from your hand."
I felt very weak.
I worked, I worked, I worked on my hand, and I got a success.
So I got a college.
"I had to spend four years from my group partners, and I agreed to take me to the University of Winston, a lawyer named Susan Fiskeni. So I thought, ""I wasn't a place.""
I was in the cave.
I had the first 20 minutes of the first course I had heard in London.
It was the first night.
"So I was so scared that I was open in the morning, and I asked my head to call, ""I don't know it."" He said to me, ""No, you'll do, I've got a ceremony in your bar."
It's going to stay and you'll tell me.
It's in the case.
You're going to take all the results you need.
"So again, if you're afraid, and you're scared, your body doesn't listen to you, ""Well, it's done. I'm going to look at it!"
"You're really coming out of my hand."" You're going to work until you're going to say."" I did that."
For five years, I'm reading the high level of the school. For a few years, I'm going to Northwest, I'm going to Harvard, and I'm working there. I don't think about it, but for a long time, I thought, ""I'm not my place."
"After the first year I was in Harvard, I didn't even talk to my cabinet for a semester, and I said, ""You're not going to participate in or you're going to break."" I didn't know it well."
"He came in a completely troubled situation, and he said, ""I'm not my place."
That's the point of return for me.
Because two things happened.
First, I realized that I didn't longer pass it.
But he felt, and those particles were familiar with me.
And the second thing, I realized that he was right.
So he could look at it by imitation.
"And I said to him, ""Hey, here's a whole industry!
"I said, he's going to show himself out of the morning, he's going to show himself strong, and (Applause) you'll come into the classroom and give the best thing that you've done as today."" He did that. She didn't have any food, she didn't know he't sit here." (Laughter) A few months later he came to me and I saw him to his grandmother, not until she felt true, but it was so successful."
It changed.
I would like to tell you that,
Imagine it until it's real.
Look at yourself until you want to be one.
I want to know that.
The curved corrections can bring a lot of changes.
Now, it's about two minutes ago.
Two minutes, two minutes, two minutes.
Try to do this for two minutes before you're able to calculate the number of times, in the lift, in the room, back to the table or back to the door.
Take what you want to do.
Look at that your brain will get the best thing of the situation.
Suppose your testosterone. But reduce your body.
"""Oh, I didn't show them what I was able."" You don't allow you to end with persuasion."
"So you say, ""I'm going to reach them and show them what I'm!""
So I'd like to share it with you and others, because it's very simple.
(Laughter) You're not self-sex. (Laughter) You're publishing this lesson and sharing it with people, because people who can do it are generally people who have no technology and resources, no status and no confidence.
And share it with them that people can use it.
Because only the attention of two minutes to your body can impact their lives very significant.
Thank you.
(Applause).
We have a lot of dragonflies in the world.
The most of them in the supergles is invisible.
In terms of the characters, they're the workers who collect material that is recycled to live.
They're doing a hard, honest and necessary job that helps everyone, but they don't thank them for that.
Here, in Brazil, 90 percent of the products that will be recycled — what they collect.
Most of the cards are governed. They're flying out of the coast, and they're re-electrified to the center.
The cars remember the cart of paper made up of a tape or methane, and the gravity or the tiny art of Brazil.
And that's why I'm familiar with the super-creats that I've created.
I'm a magnetist and a activist, and my works are about the protection of social, politics and the environment.
In 2007 I turned my job from dragonflies to dragonflies to dragonflies to help the city.
But that's the time I've supported the cats.
And my work took more attention to my art and eggs, and it helped them to raise their confidence in the center of attention.
They're famous today in small places in media and social media.
Instead, I've always worked on this moment when I've been familiar with this world.
I got over 200 cars in many cities, and I invited a lot of passengers in the world.
And I realized that the galaxies with invisible things don't belong only to Brazil.
I found them in the countries that evolved like Argentina, China, South Africa, Turkey, even Japan and the U.S.
And then, I realized that more people should be involved in this question, because it was a big job.
"And then, I've created a cluster under the head of ""Laughter of my Carroza."" (Laughter) It's a cluster that can be able to finance by people."
Thank you.
(Applause)
"It was a great challenge for people who were created with the help of the crater and the crater."
The boxes supported by doctors, dentisters, kids, hairstylists, mass therapists, and well-known professionals and healthcare services.
Also, when the quarks were built by our könüllers, they gave them dragonflies to see well the airplanes and the city that didn't rains.
They also took other tools for security: atoms, dragonflies and vibrations.
And finally, they're crying by the little artists, and they're part of this wonderful and big space expedition.
"""Because I'm beautiful."" He went to Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and the smaller curibita."
"And we've created a Pimpx version of the Pimpx version that was facilitated by the people, created by the TEDx, which was encrypted and funded by the public."
So it's going to join everyone.
"In two years, 170 cataracts, 800 volunteers and 200 young people, and more than 1,000 donors have been joined in the carbox ""Laughter."" They've been trained to re-educate in local schools with their help."
Now, when the galaxies put invisible, they became people who were honorable and appreciated.
Because of the magnificent quarks, they're able to deal with wonderful ideas, they could increase their revenues and their relationship with society.
Now, I invite you to find the crater in your city and other invisible super heroes and recognize them.
Try to see the world as a whole, without limits and curves.
If you want to believe, there's more than 20 million galaxies in the world.
So when you see someone next, know them as a part of our life.
Thank you very much orbigado.
(Applause)
On 5 November 1990, a person named Al-Séyyid Nosair, went to a hotel in Manhattan to Ravvin Meir Khan, the leader of the Jewish Department of Defense.
He was not guilty by the death of Nosair, but when he was charged with other criminals, he had a number of governments in New York with other criminals, including tunels, colonies and the headquarters of the U.N.
Fortunately, the plans were underfinished by the FTB officer.
But unfortunately, in 1993, the World Heritage Center didn't prevent bombing.
And finally, Nosair was in the southwest.
The Ar-Syyid Nosair is my father.
In 1987, in Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania, in Pennsylvania, I was looking forward to the world as a son of a miserable American, a teacher of modern school, and they didn't have to go to me to live a happy childhood.
When I was seven years old, my relationship began to change.
My father caused me to see that many Muslims, including many Muslims, are very few people who are witnessed.
And I've learned this from my life experience: when people know each other enough, they don't take a long time to understand that the expectations of each other are the same from our life.
There's a few people in every world who have a crater against their faith in every world, and who want others to drive their lives, even if they feel the damage of any way they want to do.
So a few months ago, my father was sitting in front of me and told me that we went to policing training in London for the last few weeks.
But he told me that I'm going to go with him in the morning.
We came to the Calverton Attainment Police, and then we didn't know that it was in the secret evidence of FTB.
When my dad came to me, my father helped me to keep my body in my flower, and he realized how to deal with 30 meters.
The last smile that I've taken on that day came down to the tiny orange lamp on the nectar, and it's a stroke, and it's all surprised by it, especially I.
"And I went to other men and said, ""Ibn Abuh,"" from Arabic, ""It's the bal of his father."
They laughed all of the words that said, but a few years later, I realized what they're really smiling.
They thought that my father was powerful, and the terrible thing I had seen.
Lastly, these people were familiar with the furks of 700 kilograms around the Earth Earth's Heritage Center, which was suspended by the Earth's Pacific underwater, because six people died and more than 1,000 people were ran.
And I've taken these people to me, and I've taken it to me.
"I'm OK."" They were people I've called my mother.
As I was 19, we changed our lives 20 times, and this change caused my friends to have little time during my childhood.
It became one of us that we didn't feel close to myself, and we didn't move to another city.
As a new one, I've always turned to the goal of the kids that you're going to do.
I kept my self secret from my school partners to not be in the center of prison, but it was so clear that the new student was enough to have the most string and top of the ceremony.
So I spent a lot of my time in my house reading a book, watching TV or playing games.
So I had conflicts with the skills of social communication, and I was not ready for the right face of life as a fanist family.
I grew up in a environment that was justified because people were imagined like religion and religion.
What happened when I opened my eyes?
So one of my first experiences that lead me to this kind of thinking was the time of President's election in the year 2000.
I've taken my job to participate in the National Children's Convention in Filadelf.
And the group I realized, especially, was a fight between young people, and I was not a fight against the situation as one who was affected by the violence of the children who had a lot of their lives.
Our group was people who had a different way of life.
I learned that one of the kids I was Jewish in the last days of the convention.
This fact was only discovered for a few days, but sometimes I realized that there was no conflict between us.
He had never been a Jewish friend before, and I said the right, and I felt angry because I was aware of the barries that I had never lost me for the whole life.
And a more important point of return was what I found in the busch Gardens in the evening for extra profit.
I was around people with different religions and cultures, and it played a fundamental role in developing this experience.
I learned that my life was a big part of my life that homosexuality is a fault, and in general, all of the genes have the meaning of it.
The work came out that I had the opportunity to work with gay artists in one of the scales, and at the same time, they were the most good and the least fruitful people that I saw like many of them.
I found. It's a sense that I've built in me, like a kid who was very young, like a person who was very young, and it's a sense to remind others who don't want to me.
And I've been able to compare stereotypes that I learned from my childhood with the proper life experience.
I'm unknowable how it's a sense of being gay, but I'm very well familiar with what it's because it doesn't matter you.
"And then, ""The Daily Show."" Con Stüart helped me to be honest with myself about my respect for fanaticity, and he helped me to understand that human moral, religious and sexual orientation are not related to his nature."
In the moment I needed, Con Stüart, when my father had to tell me, he had actually attracted me in the sense of the word.
The leadership comes from a long time unexpected country, and the fact that the Jewish comedian showed me more positive effects than my extreme father in my world.
One day of the days, my mother and my mother were compassionate about the world's perspective, and my mother told me a word that I couldn't get out of my dream for the whole life.
"My mother looked at me with the eyes of fatigue, as a person who lived so long as a pragmatic life, and he said, "I was scared to hate humans."
I realized how intelligent it required energy to tell the sense of hat in a moment.
That's not my right name.
I changed my name when I decided to start a new life when I started my relationship with my father.
So why did I put myself in a danger?
She's pretty simple.
And I hope that sometimes someone who comes to violence would hear my story and have the difference that it's a better way. I wasn't fanatic, although I didn't have a intolerant ideology.
In fact, I decided to use my life experience as a fight against terrorism and fanatic.
And I'm going to say that the terrible pain and the losses that terror victims and their parents, the terrorists, they're living with them.
I'm going to challenge my father's behavior because of terror victims.
As a simple example of my advisors, I'm a real challenge of having the faith of violence and not going to go through the path of his son.
I'm not like my father.
Thank you very much. (Applause) Thank you all. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) (Applause) I remember. (Applause)
It's good morning.
Are we sure?
They've taken the name written on them, but I'd like to ask you, here someone wrote his name in Arabic on his marriage?
Nobody wrote? Nobody? Well, there's no problem.
One day ago, I was sitting with my friend in the restoran and I buy food.
"I looked at the office and I said, ""Do you have a woman? (Laughter)"
He looked weird to me thinking he had heard the word wrong.
"He said, ""Applause? (In English)" I said, ""No honor, no honor."" He said, ""You don't know what they say to him?"" "I know.""
"He said, ""No! It's called him a menu or a menu."" The French requirement is okay?"
"Well, let's do this!"" He said to his office."
"He was crazy to talk to me. He said to himself, "If he was the most cool girl in this world, I didn't look at him.""
What's the meaning of saying the word ""Menu"" in Arabic?
And this was two words, and the Lion's young boy left behind, and he argued as ignorance.
How could he talk like this, right?
And at that moment, I started thinking.
And that caused me.
It's really worth the dragonflies of the man.
They don't accept me because they speak me in my country.
Can this happen on another side?
How did we see here?
But there's a lot of people here, like me, who are doing a step in their lives that they're not only able to tell them that they're modern and cultural, but they're doing something that happened with them in the past.
Should I forget my whole culture, my ideas, my mind and my experiences?
Children's stories about war could be our best experiences.
I've learned Arabic just to adapt everything I've learned.
Should I forget to be one of them?
Have you ever had a sense here?
Nevertheless, I tried to understand it.
I didn't want to justify him with the shame he made me.
Arabic doesn't respond to the demands of this day.
It's not a language of science or research, or it's not a language that we're confident to present a large-scale research project that we're habituated in our universities, and it's not a language that we use in our airports.
If we did that, they would put our shoes.
So I have to use my language? We should all give this question!
You want to use Arabic. How should we use?
It's a reality.
But there's another more important reality that we need to think.
Arabic is the primary language.
When you study, you have to be perfect in your parent language to be perfect in other languages.
The perfect idea in primary language is the requirement to express ideas in other languages in a creative way.
Why?
When she first started writing, she used Arabic when she started writing.
It was created by a little boy in the village that grew up with all his ideas, images and illusions.
So when he started writing in English, he had enough basis.
And even when he writes in English, when he read his letters, you feel that piece, you pass those parts.
You can imagine that the guy who's written in English is Odur, who comes from the mountains of Livan.
It's a sense that nobody has to dispute.
Second, it's often called that if you want to kill a nation, the only way to kill the people is to kill his language.
It's a reality that evolved companies know.
The Germaners, the French, the corners, the Chinese — these nations are different from this.
So they're a law to protect their own languages.
They honor it.
So they use a lot of money to develop a language.
Do we know more of them?
Well, we're not from the evolved world, but the idea of this universe doesn't yet come to us, and we wanted to stop with the cultural world.
One time, they're like us, but they've done research for development, and they've taken their languages, like Turkey, Malaysian and etc, and they've taken their languages with themselves, and they've preserved it as they don't get it.
They approached their language.
Because if you take a product from Turkey or another country, and if there's no label on it in Turkish, it's not a native product.
You didn't believe it was a native product.
They were a customer like before, and they're a poor customer as we're in the most times.
So they had to protect their own languages to develop and produce.
"If I'm saying, ""Laughter, Justice, Independence."" What will this remind you?"
What doesn't remember, right?
Who, though, how and why it's.
The language isn't just the way to get words out of our mouth, it's not the way to talk.
The language shows some phases of our life and the terminology of our emotions.
So when we say, ""The truth, the suverenity, the independence,"" there's a particular picture in your mind, in the particular history, there's a particular day particles."
It's not a language, two or three words or a word.
It's the internal idea of how we think, how we see each other, how others see us.
What's the invention?
Why can you say that this person understands, right?
"So if I say, ""Laughter, dominance, independence,"" or if your son came to say, ""Do you live in prison?""
What do you feel?
If you don't see the problem, it's good that I'm going out and I'm not going to talk to the empty place.
The idea is that these words remind us something special.
I have a French friend who is married with the French.
I asked him one day, how are the things going on?
"He said, ""Every thing is good. But I've tried a day to translate the word ""box."" (Laughter) (Applause) We write a woman wrongly said, ""box."" And then he tried to tell him the word all the night."
"He didn't know, ""How can the man be so bizarre?""
Does he want to suicide?
""It's me right? (In English)" It's one of a few missions."
We started to think that because she didn't understand the hand, she couldn't tell him that word, and she didn't understand it. It's different.
"And my husband said to me, ""He's listening to Faluza with me, and a night I tried to translate it to him that he would feel what I heard when I heard of Faluza."" And the woman wrote it to translate it to him, ""I've extended my hands and I've been a son."" (Laughter) And this is the problem: "And because you're there, I've taken my hands back and left you." (Laughter)"
translate it for me.
(Applause) What did we do to protect Arabic?
We turned it into a civil society question, and we started a campaign to protect Arabic.
"So many people said to me, ""What's you going to worry?"
"Don't forget that sense and make it fun for yourself."" There's no problem!"
"The key of the campaign to protect your language was, ""I talk to you from the east, and you're going to respond to me from the West.""
"We didn't say, ""No, we don't accept it or it."" We didn't choose it because they didn't understand us so."
And if someone speaks to me in that way, I hate Arabic.
We say, (Applause) We want to change our reality, and we're going to replicate our lives, our desire and our everyday lives.
We're a genius like us, and we're a genius thinking like us.
"So, ""I talk to you from the east, but you're responding to me from the West.""
It's very simple, at the same time, creative and credible.
And then we started another campaign that was written in the torphe.
"You don't see this example in the sky, on the wall of a black and yellow lens, it was written, ""Don't kill your language!""
Why? Of course, don't kill your language.
We don't kill our language from the birth.
If we had to kill our language, we had to find our identity.
We had to find our existence.
We had to go back at the beginning.
It's also a serious question of losing our chance to be modern and cultural.
And then we disseminate images of the Arab men and girls that were flying.
""Cool"" pictures of girls and boys."
We're very cool.
"And somebody says, ""Oh, you're English speaking!"" I say, ""No! I didn't understand the word of alcohol."" They want to say, how much they believe, but give me a wonderful word that it's better."
"I'm going to continue to say ""Internet."" I'm saying, ""I'm going to the world's cluster."" (Laughter) Because it doesn't matter, we don't want to ignorate ourselves."
But as we're going to this point, we have to believe that if it's a question, we don't allow those who are bigger or think there's a nüfse in our face to control us or think and feel that they want us.
It's the idea of being a creator.
If we can't fly on the sky, or we can't fix a raket, and so we can be a creator.
Now, you're a creative project.
Creation in your primary language is a way.
Let's start from this.
Let's take a novel or take a short movie.
One single novel can make us global again.
It can hit Arabic to become a nuclei again.
"So it's not easy to say, ""There's no solution."" There's a dropout way."
But we have to know and believe that there's a way of solution, and that's our obligation to be part of the way of solution.
So what can you do today?
Flowers, who vibrate?
And if I put my time, I'm asking you more, if you're Arabic, English, French or Chinese.
But when you write in Arabic, don't write with the graph of Latin.
(Applause) It's a disaster! It's not a language!
You're entering the virtual world with a virtual language.
It's not easy to fly back from one way.
It's the first thing we can do.
Second, there are many other things we can do.
We didn't come up here today to believe each other.
We're here to focus on the importance of protecting this language.
Now, I'm going to open you a sir.
The body knows his father for the first time through a language.
"And when my daughter was born, I'm going to say to him, ""This is your father, love you. (Laughter)" I'm going to say to him in English, ""This is your dad, honey."" And my daughter Nura says that in the supermarket he says to me Arabic, ""Be thank you."" I said to him, ""Laughter, Mom," I'm going to do and I don't hope that nobody heard him."
(Applause) Let's be able to adapt ourselves to this culture. (Applause)
I've learned a few things when I've done these 30 days tests.
To study, I took a picture every day in a month.
I'm 30 days before I started a experiment.
He's very bad.
They're really fun.
(Applause)
Since I read the school well, my expectations were high. I started a life of a student who was full of a feeling of love, walking and journey.
But when I realized, I felt very miserable, confident, I was scared of the people involved, the ones that I felt failure and the space I felt in my future.
"So, as I started, when I was crying like I was doing, I was sitting in the cave, and when I left the room, I heard a strange painful voice, ""He left the room."" I felt at Elizabeth."
There was no one in my side, but the light and the precision of the surface that I had heard was uncertain.
"""He opens the door."" I've heard."
This was the beginning. It's coming.
And the days ago, and the weeks later, everything I had done was told me with a third person, part of a third person.
"He's going to engineering."
It sounds like neutra, pain, and even a while later, his friend and his hopeful voice, and I thought that it's the feelings that I don't get excessively unified at the time.
For my misal, when I'm in the beginning, I've always hidden my heart and my real particles, the voice came out.
So the words behind this thought emerged: normal people don't hear sounds, and I didn't hear was a serious point.
It's the reason I've taken to my college.
I needed the right, the interest and the courage, and I started to talk to him about my magic writer.
"So I worked on the student TV as a manufacturer of campus news, and I had to go to the teacher at the time to build the night, ""I want to go, I want to go."
And then, the situation started to fly out of my surveillance quickly.
I was sitting in the hospital, and then the schizofreniosis blew down, and then the worst thing: a terrible confusion about myself and my future, a feeling of sickness and sickness.
The sound that I've heard was not a fresh life experience, but because I thought it was a symptoom, I started to increase my fear and irritation.
It was an agressive situation against this mind, a kind of psychological war, and it started to increase the numbers of sounds, and it started to be a more enemy and angry voice.
Have you ever seen a crater that's in water?
In the meantime, fear, escape, unintendedness and unintendedness, I was not in the perspective of creating peace and peace in this war that I felt uncomfortable.
Two years later, my life started to become worse.
Now, I had all the dragonflies of the girl: terrible sounds, bizarre images, strange, unconscious calculations.
Now, when I look at the cloud of those years and the unconsciousness, I think a man died, and a man was saved.
A bordered and tight person was sent to the surface, and he was going to go back from that journey, and then I had to go to someone I had to get up and get up.
Over my life, many people have lost me, and they all remember, but these things were very weak and weak compared to people who helped me.
I think Eleanor's ability to do this.
"So, if it rains in the summer, it's certainly going to spread."" He said, in 14 minutes, it doesn't have to do so much to thank those beautiful people who are going to fight with me and me, and I'm going to go back, and I'm looking forward to be able to thank those wonderful people."
Of course, it was hard to believe in this because the sounds came to the enemy and the exaggerator, so the first important step was that I didn't learn to understand what I had calculated the truth before.
For my mission, I've learned to describe the sounds that they're going to attack my house — not as a real and ordinary danger, but as a fear and a feeling of danger.
And sometimes I believed them.
One night, even I'm sitting in the door of my parents, and I remember to take the boxes to protect them from the sounds I actually calculate.
"You can say, ""Don't work with me."
"I said, ""Do I have a plastic patch?"" That's my strategy."
And when I realized that, I've been back to psychiatry in a completely different role, when I got out of these particles now, and I've got back to psychiatry.
Now, I'm proud of being an Intervoice, an international gender partners, who are part of the organization of Harka, and that's going to go through the work of Mr. Marius Romme and Dr. Sandra Escher, and the next voice calls as a strategy of life, as a mental approach, ignorance, not as a dysfunction of schizofrenia, but as a difficult, important and meaningful thing that's required to learn.
What this kind of society is possible, even now it's going to build.
There's a statement from Sweden that if the social change begins, there's no return.
It's not going to push people.
Now it doesn't inspire people who are not afraid.
In the last 20 years, we're not going to expand the Earth in five continents and 26 countries, and we're the opportunity of people who have courage, courage and courage and courage and courage, and we're hopeful car and prosecutors.
Like Peter Levin said, it's a unique creature that has a mental spirit to use this ability that has the instinct of human giving.
In this perspective, the greatest honor for our community is to help someone who needs to give, to stay together, to extend hand, to share and thank his sentence.
We're unique. We're not payable.
What we're doing is never taken from us or get it out of us.
The light doesn't shine forever.
"So, as a parent once said to me, ""Don't tell others what they say in your bar."
"So talk about yourself."" Thank you very much."
(Applause)
I'm here to talk about my photograph.
But that's a picture?
Because, of course, it's not a picture you can take with this camera.
And again, my friend to photograph started when I took my first photo at 15 years old.
I put it with my friend who was an early interview, but a little different way, because when I use the camera, I planned a kind of process before.
When you take a picture with the camera, the work is ready when you print the button of the device.
I think, photography wasn't just made of being right at the right time.
I thought everyone could do this.
So I wanted to create something different, something that started to happen after the images were taken.
So pictures like this: it's a circuit that's ongoing on a road.
But it's a unexpected game.
And even though, it looks pretty close.
Or pictures like this — both dark and colored, but they're all going to protect a certain degree of realization.
When I'm real, I'm looking for photo-realism.
Because, of course, these are not the images we can actually take, but I'd like to have the visible images that we can take with a camera.
I'd like to have some pictures that you're going to think about to understand the universe.
So it's really connected to keep a better idea than to remember.
Well, there's a pattern that gives him the right look?
Does it relate to these details or to the colors?
Does it relate to light?
What is the creation of science?
Sometimes it's a perspective of creating science.
But then, how he realized the world, the two-dimensional (2D) is the key to do it.
It's not what this reality really is, it's what real looks to us.
So the key idea is very simple.
And I'm looking at this when I put real works into a place, creating a real inventor that I've created a alternative reality.
I'm going to show you a simple example.
There's three numbers of physical dragonflies that are perfect imagined, which are connected to our three-dimensional(3D) world.
But when it comes together in a certain way, it looks like a three-dimensional object that's still available.
But we know that it doesn't exist.
So we're playing games with our brain, because our brain doesn't understand the sense of reality.
And I see the same process when I combine pictures.
It's actually connected to combine different realities.
So a picture is what shows real things, things that we don't think about, things that are around us in our everyday lives.
And when you combine images, it's really important to look at it, because it's probably wrong.
What I want to say is three simple sources that we have to do to get a real result.
As you see, there's no particular part of these images.
But when it's connected, it takes something like this.
So in the first source, the perspective of the combined images should be the same.
Second, the same should be the light of the combined images.
And in these two ways, these two conditions are expected — from the same height and the same light.
Third, it's impossible to design the picture, end the one on the wall, separate the other from the wall.
It has to be unified in a way it's created.
We remove the boundaries between different images, using the boundaries between the surface, the contrast and the light, using the depth of the surface, the effects like the left color and the light, and allow us to look like a single image, although there's hundreds of details.
And that's another example.
(Laughter) People can think that's a region, and it's the bottom of the changed cluster.
But in fact, this picture came into the unification of pictures of different places.
I think it's easier to create a place, to find a place, and you don't have to change your ideas so little.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And I knew that's a few months when I've come in the winter of intelligence, and I've got a few months to find the different places that the inventor will fully complete.
For example, the fish was taken at the official fish.
And the continents are different.
Six parts of water were taken in a stone cabinet.
And yes, even the house on the surface of the name was red to see Sweden more.
So it's possible to get a really close result in terms of planning.
It's always a swing, it begins with a idea.
And then we're going to combine different pictures.
In this way, every part was well planned.
And if you take pictures well, the result can be very beautiful and also very realistic.
So we have all the tools we need, and the only thing that limits us is our vital force.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Chris Anderson: Julian, thank you.
So there's a data that Wikileaks has released more information than the world's media published in the last few years.
Is that possible?
Julian Assange: Well, can this be true?
Does the rest of the world have to worry about how bad the media works? A small group of activists can disseminate more information than the world's media.
CA: How do you do that?
How are people disseminating these records?
How is the principle of self preserved?
JA: So as we know, these are people who disseminate data, and there are different ways to get these data to us.
We call countries like Switzerland and Belicans to prevent surveillance, to encrypt data to easily disseminate on the Internet, to protect the law.
It's encrypted or encrypted, and it's analyzed, formed, formed, and when there's a big database, it's a little tough thing — it's open to the government, and we protect ourselves against the possible legitimate and political actions.
CA: So you can't know who's the source of data.
JA: It's true. We know them very rarely. If we find the source of data, we immediately destroy that information.
(Applause) Zibil.
(Laughter) CA: I think it's CIA, it's a TED code. (Laughter)
I think we're looking at the mosquitos.
This is the information that was broken a few years ago.
Let's look at you.
It was a story from Kenya.
Can you talk about how you're able to cut this story?
JA: This is the Royal report.
After the election of 2004, Kenya was an investigation carried out by the government.
By the election of 2004, Kenya was governed by Daniel Arab Moi for 18 years.
He was a dictator of my property in Kenya.
When they came to the government with the power of the coalition and started a fight with corruption, they published this joint report by spending two million pounds.
The community used this report at the time and then in Kenya as a political force against Moses, the most rich man.
It's like the original book of Kenya journalism.
In 2007 I went to Kenya a little before the 28 December election, and I could get records.
This report was published three days after the new President Kabi, Daniel, who started to come up with the Arab Moon's money, and the report was devastated by the President Kabi.
CA: The short of a long word — the report was not directly translated to the Kenyan press, but through the roads, and you think it changed the result of these elections.
JA: Yes. The news was published on the first page of the Guardian, and then in countries around Kenya, Tanzania and Kenya in Africa.
The news came out.
In a few days, Kenya media started to write very easily about this.
20 days later, it was published in the Kenyan press, and the Kenyan security service reports changed 10 percent of the sounds, and it led to change the results of the election.
CA: So, what's the data you've invented really changed the world?
JA: Yeah.
(Applause) CA: Now, there's a video about the weather cell in India.
The video is a bit long. It's a short clip picture.
First of all, there's a little violence in this video.
Radio: ... If you're up, you're open up.
Now they're looking at, they're looking at Xammer.
It's the Earth. The Sun.
Now, if you see all, you know it. Thank you.
All shot.
The Sun, the fire!
(Applause from automated weapon) Take it, continue. (Applause from automated weapon) I'm going to say.
Bushmaster Two-Six, Bushmaster Two-Six.
You had to go back, here!
It was, we've killed all eight people.
There are two dragonflies, and we're going to do the fire.
It was. They all died.
Two-Six, Two-Six, we're acting.
Oops. Thank you. What was it?
Zibil, Kyle. Ahaa, it's a solution, yeah.
CA: How did the image of this video happen?
JA: It's hard for people who are hard to do this.
Two people were sent to India to study this video.
It's actually one of three attempts in the video.
CA: If I don't do it, there's 11 people, including two Reuters's officers, who died?
JA: Yes. Two Reuters workers died, two children died.
In total, 18 to 26 people died.
CA: The publication of these things caused a large impact.
You think what's the primary reason of this wound and the failure?
JA: I don't know exactly, I think people see the unperformance of forces.
They're proud of 30mm-dimensional dragonflies that fly over people who fly gently to the flower, and they're killing even those who save the injuries.
There were two journalists who were accurate, who were not prosecutors, and who saw their work.
CA: The U.S. security agent, Bradley Manning, was arrested, and he said, in the interview room, with a video, he confessed that 280,000 U.S. government's writing has sparked you.
Is that true?
JA: We rejected those books.
Five days ago, he was arrested after he had 150,000 letters, he had 50 letters.
In the previous year, we published the official records of the U.S. government, but they don't have to do this.
I traveled to that government.
CA: If you had received a diplomatic document from the U.S. government?
JA: We've published them. (CA: Have you done this? JA: Yeah. CA: Why? JA: What's the fact that the country's actually in these documentations reveals the point of human rights in Arab countries.
If you open a secret document, it's a type of material.
CA: Let's talk about it a little bit more detail.
In general, what kind of ideology are you relying on?
Why do you calculate the publication of a secret document?
JA: There's a question that what information is important for the world, what information can cause to restore.
In fact, it's a lot of information.
The idea of the economic power that institutions have to hide is that there's a new and good thing that will be the emergence of those news, and that institutions that have these data know how to hide their data.
In practice, it's always the way. The history of journalism is about it.
CA: But it's not dangerous, it's not dangerous, it can be a bad result for people, even for the whole society.
JA: There's no case in the data we've been disseminated.
So we have a policy to protect damage.
There are some personal data that they're connected to themselves and then we're publishing.
And there are blood vessels — for example, the advice of the disease with the doctor, the rules are preserved by the law, but we're working with news carriers who really know what they do.
CA: Well, you know all the jobs.
"If someone who's a son service in the U.S. office came to you and said, ""You know that someone wants to spread to you with any purpose? This video."
The American military shows people laugh when they're dying.
It shows millions of people in this world that Americans don't have human particles. It's not true.
"My son isn't like this. What are you courageous doing this?"" What do you answer?"
JA: There's a lot of things.
But remember that people in Baghdad, Iraq, Afghanistan don't need to see this video; they see it every day.
They don't change their minds. They don't change their minds, they don't change parts.
They're seeing these things every day.
But it's going to change the relationship of people who pay money for this fight. That's what we're doing.
CA: So you don't find a way to light the secrets of governments and companies.
It's good to light.
But the strange thing is that you have to hide your sources to light your eyes.
JA: Well, it's not OK. There's no people who've been against the WikiLeaks.
Or we don't have any data on the basis of any sources.
If there's things and there's a lot of things, it might be hard for us. We're working so that people who are working with us try to help us to continue their work.
CA: What are you think about what I've heard like I've ever heard — what are the TED followers thinking about this?
There are two kinds of ideas about WikiLeaks and Julian.
One — a gentleman who's lighting the connection.
It's a dangerous journey.
Who think it's amazing?
How are you looking at dangerous?
JA: Well, if you don't know, there's a few people.
CA: These were the people of my property, Julian.
We have to try a little more. Let's show another example.
I think it's not published this time, but it's going to be published on TED.
It's a interesting fact that happens in the next time, right?
What's this document?
JA: It's a example of what we see every day.
Last year — November — in Albania, there were fluctuations like the Gulf of Mexico, not even strong as the Gulf.
So we've found that a engineering report that actually, the explosion number, was carried out by the way that the customs of the companies put the cargo cars.
And the government of the U.S. and others were here.
But the technical report didn't have any relationship with them. It was a little hard document.
We didn't know who he wrote and what it was about.
We've been a little doubt that digital oil company could also be a game.
"So we looked at the document, and we said, ""We're a little suspected."
We don't know what we're going to do.
"It's good. It looks right, but we can't confirm."" We've just responded from the company who wrote this text a week ago — (Laughter) it was written, ""We want to find the source of information."" We said, ""Don't even give information."
What kind of document you're talking about all over all?
Does your blood belong to you?
"What's really?"" They said, at the answer, they sent Microsoft Word ID on the screen and sent a list of the owner of the document."
That's what it's happening.
(Applause) So there's a lot of things.
One of the ways to determine the source of material is one of the methods that try to write a letter.
CA: Have you any information about the BP?
JA: Yeah, and so much, but we're actually working for funding for the website, and engineers go out of their hands.
We've reduced the news that we've released for the last few months to protect our social interests, because we've tried to restore the key of the website.
It's a little problem.
As institutions that start in another new activity, we're getting up with a challenge, but we don't have enough jobs to transmit and publish all of those data, but it's actually a lot of information.
CA: Well, what's what you need to do for the major volunteer journals and/eller journals to pay a job?
JA: Yes. People we're going to believe.
And it's hard to develop the data that we're doing in our hands in a little different way, and we need people who are able to deal with high-scale and now security laws.
CA: Can you tell you why it started?
So I'm not reading that when you're a kid, you've changed 37 schools.
Is that true?
JA: My Valideans were in a movie business, and I didn't leave religious meetings, and they were the result of them.
(Laughter) CA: Psychologists accept this as a paranoia sense.
JA: Are you looking for film business?
(Laughter) (Applause) CA: Because I know, when you're young, you're a hacker, it's a problem with reporters.
JA: I was a journalist.
I was one of the young journalists.
I was arrested because I was published in a young age.
You have to take a little attention to the hackers.
It's possible to do different things with the systemic path.
Unfortunately, most of the Indian hackers have taken a lot of money on a bank account for the Russian Mafia.
The Xarker's selling was not like the first.
CA: Now, I don't think you've been doing money for someone, what's the key values?
Can you give them a brief information, or can you talk about why they're created or about events?
JA: I think there's no event.
But my fundamental values: I think the talentful and courageous people don't produce victims; they help the victims.
And that's what I learned from people who lived like my father and my father.
CA: The poor, the poor, doesn't make human victims; does it protect them?
JA: I'm a little prosecuted person, I'm not going to protect them completely, and I'm not going to escape them, but I'm protecting the victims by detecting people from crimes.
And that's my character that I have for a long time.
CA: Can you talk about what's happening in Iceland in the last few minutes?
The fact that you've published here is that it was a problem with the bank, and the news agency was also sent to a court.
In fact, the website was captured.
You've created a good image in Iceland. What happened then?
JA: This was a big question.
It was a economic crisis in Iceland.
It was one of the largest fractures in the world.
The global product in the banking sector was 10 times more than the other areas.
We published this information in July of the last year.
"The money was not released on the TV, and it was sent to the TV court before, and we were five of the news of the court office, before, and the hardware didn't know what will do, "It didn't happen. What should we do?""
We published news instead of TV on a web, and we've been arrested in Iceland, and we've gone and talked about the question.
In the community, everyone believed that this could happen again, and at the point, after a few Icelandic politicians and international experts interviewed, there was a new law project that will protect the government of Iceland, and that's one of the most fundamental laws in the world that serve journalists to protect, equal to Nobel Prize for liberation.
Iceland knew that other skandinavi countries, like Norway, were in the system.
And just a month ago, this law was secretly adopted in the Islamic parlament.
CA: Wowu
(Applause) So let's look like this, Julian.
How do you believe that it's going to happen? How will a lot of money control everything in the secret way, or would people like to control the Big Bang, or it's another way?
JA: I don't really believe what it's going to be.
All over the world — from the U.S., from China to the U.S. and around the world, the demands of freedom of speech and copyright are growing.
It's hard to see how it's going to happen.
The time that we're living is very interesting. We can change everything in a very cool piece.
CA: Yeah, I feel what our listeners want to say, Julian, be careful, be empowered with you.
JA: Thank you very much, Chris. (CA: Thank you.) (Applause)
I'm a writer.
I'm my job to tell a story and write a novel, and I'm going to tell you a little about the industry of writing a story today, and I'm going to talk a little about the poor creatures called cinus.
But let me tell you a little bit about your personal story before you start it.
Of course, I'm going to use words, and you'll find a couple of places when you hear my head.
I was born in a Turk family in Strasbourg, in French.
I've been married a little bit after that, and I've come to Turkey with my mother.
At that time, I grew up as a single child in my mother's history.
In the 1970s, the situation in Ankaria was a little strange.
Most of the families in our village were large families, which were the father's family leader, and I grew up with my mother who was the only married woman in the patriotic environment.
In fact, I grew up around two groups of women.
On the other hand, she was a Jewish, global, modern, European woman — my mother.
But on the other hand, it's always a mental, less intelligent, less rasional pattern.
I'm looking at the dragonflies of the dragonflies in the cave, and it's a different sort of kind of structure to remove the eyes of the Devil.
And those deep dragonflies, people who've lost their hands, went to visit why.
Every time, my grandmother would put something in Arabic, and it would hit yellow dragonflies so much of the losses that they've taken in the hand.
And then one of the dragonflies embedded into galaxies.
A week later, he went to the hospital's music.
I know that it can be amazing to talk about these things in front of the scientific audience and the brave man, but I didn't see that nobody came back to the audience or the people who came back to the cure of different curves.
I asked me how did it do. It was the power of the word?
"He said, ""Well, the god has good, but the power of the fundamental places."" There's a lot of important lesson in my teachings of him, if you want to do something in your life, if you want to do something in your life, if you want to be sick, or the soul of the human, you need to go through the dragonflies."
It's going to be built inside.
Now, we're all inside social and cultural zones.
We're all inside it.
We're all born in a kind of family, in a kind of cell, in a kind of cell.
But when we don't connect with a day outside the world we're there, we're confronted with the risk of building inside and outside.
We can reduce our own power. Our body is suspended. We can lose our sense of humanity when we're very long in the environment.
Our friends, our neighbors, our partners, our partners, our family, and if we read very much, it's a lot of what we're concerned.
In Turkey, women like my grandmother do something like this, they're covered the surface of the brain with particles, or they turn the surface of the body into the wall.
It comes from faith in the East, and it's not easy to look at his image for a lot of time.
Well, it's one of the greatest dangers of our world where we're living in images that share our thoughts.
And it starts everywhere, between liberals and the monarchs, agnostic and faithful, the rich and the poor, the East and the West.
We form groups based on fluctuations and similarities, and we create stereotypes about others.
I think, writing industry could be the key way to pass these cultural gettos.
Stories can't go on the surface of our minds, but if we don't know the boundaries.
And when we look out of these equations, we can love to see the other worlds, even we can see.
When I was eight, I started to write stories.
One day, my mother gave me a colored sticker, and he told me that my personal stories would be a good idea to write here.
Now, I think it's a little fear of my translation, thinking about that time.
I didn't share my stories with my family at home, but it wasn't good to tell my traveling friends.
I was a kid who was in the inner door, in the middle of my hand to talk with the dragonflies, and I thought that my mother was a good idea to write my everyday imagination.
But he didn't know that I thought that my life was really hard, and what I wanted to do was to write about this uninteresting life.
Instead, I started to write about myself, not about others, but about things that don't happen.
So I started to write that I'm going to become my love of life.
In the last time, writing was for me a life of more people than the autobiography manifest, stories of others.
Let me look at a little bit: I'm going to explain these things that happen in my life.
And there's another thing that happened at the front of this space.
My mother became a diplomat.
And I went out of this small, ambitious, middle-class environment, in the international school environment in Madrid, and I was the only Turk in the school.
"The first time I was in a tough environment that I was called ""typic foreign," and there were children from all the nations in Senegal, but it created an institution of eukaristic democracy that was not observered by the cosmopolitan or at school."
In fact, in this museum, children were accepted as they represent their personalities, not as a bigger people.
We looked like the U.S., and it was fun, except a bad event in behalf of the people or talking about it.
So it's surrounded by a kind of infectious source, it's always happening.
And I remember that when I was in this school, it was a military movement in Turkey, it tried to kill the Turkic armed Papan, and in the Eurasian music audience, Turkey took 0 numbers.
(Laughter) At that time, I spent a journey to come out of school and become a marine.
So, for the first time, in this school, I saw a sense of cultural stereotypes.
"No kids asked me about ""Midnight Express,"" and they asked me to take a few cigarets per day, because they took all kinds of cigarets, and they asked me to keep my head back at the beginning of the age."
I've learned three stereotypes about Turkey here, these are: politics, cigarettes and headquarters.
After Spain, we went to Ireland, Germany and back to England.
And I thought that my imagination and my vital force were the living room that I could transport with myself, all of those trips.
Stories gave me a sense of coherence, of continuity and of continuity — I was not in real life.
When I was 20 years old, I moved to the city of Istanbul, which I loved very much.
I lived in a very cosmopolitic and living environment, and I wrote a single of my novel here.
In 1999, when I was sick in Istanbul, I was there.
The event that I saw at the 3th morning, when I went out of the fast building, stopped me.
Hisly, he had a senior seller, she didn't sell alcohol in the shop, she didn't talk to people outside and marginaal lives.
In the beginning, there was a long black pair, sitting on the front of the transsexual surface of the eye.
And I saw that it offered him from the cigar that the dragonflies of the dragonflies of the box, and it's the rest of the event that I think of that night is — it's going to take a cracks along the front of the transsexual box that's crying with the seller.
When we're confronted with death and gravity, our global differences are eliminated, but we're all one, even for a few hours.
But I always thought stories have a visual effect.
I don't want to say that science is strong as a failure, but when you read a good novel, we start to know people who are not found in the dark of the night, and sometimes we don't think good.
A little later, I went to the college of girls in Boston, and then in Michigan.
It's not only from the geological perspective, but from the view of my language, it's a complete change.
I started writing in English.
It's a war, I'm not going to public. They ask me why I'm writing in English, and it helps me to change my writing language.
I love writing in Turk, I'm more poetic and emotional, and I love writing in English, I think it's more mathematical and intelligent.
I think I'm connected differently to every language.
As millions of people in the world, I've learned English later, and it's a language that's a word of winning.
And when you learn any language later, you're able to lose what we've learned.
We want to speak more, to speak better words, to make better conversations, to talk less, because there's a big difference between our brain and our language.
That's a terrible difference.
But if you learn to not fear him, it can stimulate us.
And that was what I learned in Boston — it was the light that I lived, and it's a flute stimulus.
And in those moments, my whole activity goes into my everyday prayers, and I'm able to put my marriage in one place after he's getting married, but after he's suffering.
I created a family life because he loved God.
(Laughter) But instead of deciding, I went to Arizona.
And because my friend was in Istanbul, I went through Arizona, and I started to go, and I couldn't feel that different in the other two points of the world.
If I mean, a part of my thing is always translated, physically and spiritually.
So my stories are always with me to keep all my experiences and parts in me.
And I think it's going to lose his magic when it's more really connected to the story than the story.
I'd like to take a view with you about this.
One of the works I've written in English, when I saw light in America, one of the public prosecutors wrote this.
"The book liked me."" He said, "But you would write a little different.""
(Laughter) I asked what I wanted to say.
"And he said, ""We're going to look at you, it's normal because many Spanish, Americans, American, Spanish characters, but there's only a Turk who's a man."" And it's actually getting in the campus in Boston, because there's more people than Turkey, but I'm going to understand what the speaker wants to say."
But I know that I'm going to continue to travel it forever.
He always wanted to be my personal manifest.
He wanted to be a türk woman in the book because I was a türk woman.
We're always talking about changing the world of stories, but we can also see that politics has impacted the expansion, the lecture and the understanding.
Most of the writers, especially not the south writers, are affected by this.
If you're a woman in the Islamic world like me, they're waiting to write about the Islamic woman, it's better if this Muslim woman is not happy.
They're waiting for you to write more information, crazy, typical stories, get away from the west progression.
When I was a kid, I was in Madrid, the most of my problems are available in the world literature of India.
The writers look like creative people with personal ideas, not as a representative of cultures and countries, and some writers from China, some from Turkey from Nigeria.
They're not different, they're waiting to adapt to our culture.
In 1984, when a writer and a traveling person took his interview from James Baldw, they asked him a few times about homosexuality.
"And anyone who took it into the Internet, when he tried to appreciate him as a blue writer, Baldwin, and he said, ""You don't see that I have anything else, and it's the same with what I have in all."" And when the politics markes us, it's under the danger of our freedom."
There's an unprecedented catastrophe called a great literature that's not all the writers from the west.
About 10 years ago, I remember the first great lecture in Harvard.
We were three writers, a person from Philippines, a person from Turkey, one from Indonesia to a lot.
(Laughter) But that brings us together, we didn't have a law or a law.
It was only our passports.
The writers from another country are waiting to write real stories.
There's a function in reality.
In this way, they're not only writers, but their artists are also a part of a bigger mass.
I should have to realize that this approach to story doesn't exist only in the Western.
It's like this in the world.
This was the first time I saw when I was released to a court in 2005, because of the history of history.
I've tried to write a wonderful, exciting work about the Turk and the Jewish family with the eyes of women.
When I was brought to the court, my little story became a big macro problem.
Because I wrote about the Turk-India conflict, some of them respected me, some of them respected.
But at that moment, I'd like to say to both sides, that's just literature.
It's just a story.
"I don't want to reduce the value of the work I've seen when I said ""Just a story.""
I love and support it because it's not because it's understood how it's.
The writers are recognized by the scientific perspective, but political books are sufficiently available today, but literature is not a day-day policy language.
"Cexov says, ""The correct layout of the universe and the correct layout of the matter are completely different concepts."
"And doing the second is the work of a artist."" The politics separates us from each other. The equation unifies."
Some are covered by all the divisions.
The numbers are different.
Some take the boundaries.
The numbers don't know the boundaries.
The politics was made of a strong cluster.
Nature is the south.
"In the Osman's time, there were people who told the field story called ""Laughter."" They went to the cavernators, and they told stories that they were very rare before the photographers."
They change their sounds to express the different images of the story, and they're stumbled them.
All went to listen to him, good people, even the sun, the Muslims, the non-Muslims.
"The equations had exceeded the limits, like the Middle Asia, North Africa, the Balkans and Asia."
And today stories continue to pass the boundaries.
They don't hear each other when the Palestinian and the Israeli politicians talk, but the Palestinian writer read the work of the Israeli writer read the work of a Palestinian writer, and it's connected with the way of story.
Nature has to bring us closer.
If you don't see it, it's not good work.
The books saved me — a kid who was embarrassed and embarrassed.
But there's a threat to budgeting books.
After the writer and the lawyer Rumi encountered his spiritual friend with the Sams Hebrew, the first work of Samsin was to love the destructions of those who were written in the water and put Rumi's books.
"So we say, ""The knowledge that doesn't get you away, it's more than ignorance."" The problem of today's cultural gettos is not lack of ignorance and knowledge, we think we know more about each other, we know more truth, we don't get away from ourselves, we're elite, we're distant from others and we're losing our relationship."
There's a pattern that I love: living like the behavior of the kompass.
One of the characters of the kompass is stable.
And the other thing is, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's going to change.
And that's what I'm doing.
One of the works I've written, I've moved to Istanbul to Turkey, and the other part is moving around the world, connecting across different cultures.
In this perspective, my works consider both local and universal, and I believe that it's relevant for us and for us everywhere.
If you travel to Istanbul, you'll see the Tomb House, which was the southwest of the Osmaans for 1400 years.
In the house, there's a place called the Cinks visit place in the room of the crater.
That's the place between the buildings.
I'm very pleased with this approach.
We really don't believe in the regions that are there.
We calculate those places that are created by a explosive fire, and that's a symbol of evolution, which is the mass of gravitational beings.
And I think the country where I'm looking for should have a lot of artists.
I'm privileged to change and multitasking as I write.
I love to think about 10 books later.
I love my characters to inspire me.
I can talk about a Muslim woman in one of my novel, and there's a great chance to be a happy woman, and it might be a brilliant blue professor from Norway, who's the story of my other work.
So as we're here, we can talk about everything.
"Audo Lorde says, ""Our intelligent fathers say, ""I can say, ""Well, he says, ""I'm sorry, so I'm sorry."" That's a good example."
And I don't understand why when we learn writing, we're writing about things you know for students.
Maybe it's not good for the start.
The creation doesn't matter what we're, what we know and how we have the person.
We have to teach young people and each other to write about what we feel open.
We have to go away from the national gettons, we have to recognize the other worlds.
It's like the dragonflies, the dragonflies of the universe.
Because they're not dependent on the political situation, they're all unified, and that's a good news.
"I wanted to finish my head with a old summer, ""We're familiar, we're friends, put things on the road, love, world is a fan."" Thank you very much."
(Applause)
My big idea is a little idea that will reveal a big idea of millions of mysterious ideas inside us.
I'm going to sleep this little idea.
(Laughter) (Applause) Here's a group of women. There's a couple of women.
They're women.
And I realized the value of the top very hard.
Two and a half years ago, I lost my mind from fatigue.
My head had a seat, my foot was rained, my right eye was shot five points.
I started to understand the value of the hair at that time.
And I looked at that moment, I talked to students and scientists, and so I could tell him that the only way to become more productive is to sleep normal.
(Applause) We're going to start with women in this circle.
We're going to be the most miserable in the real sense of the word.
(Laughter) (Applause) Because it's very surprising that little sleep is calculated as igidic for men.
And when he was crying with a man recently, he started talking about his bed at four hours in the first night.
"I said from my life, I didn't say, ""You know.""
"If you had five hours, the Indian nectar would be more interesting?"" (Laughter) Most people sleep less."
"So here, in Washington, you want to invite someone to eat a morning, and you ask, ""What's the eighth hour?"" And it's probably, ""8 more night, but there's nothing, they're a little tennis playing, and then I'll call you a few places."" They think they're already engaged and produced, but I think they're not doing it, because today, economic, political, and commercial leaders are enough to do a lot of bad decisions."
You have a high IQ.
It's not going to be a good leader, but to be a good leader before you get to Titanic.
The astronauts like our Titanics are enough.
I think Lehman Brothers were still giving them if they were Lehman Brothers and Brothers.
(Applause) When the kids worked seven days 24 hours, seven hours and eight hours, they could see the girls who were sitting on the top, and maybe they could understand why it would happen.
In a period that we're confronted with many fractures, it's the best thing that we're happy for ourselves, that's not dependent on where we're living.
And again, I'm trying to find your eyes, the devices, the power of the top, to see the big ideas that you can't see.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I was like a kid who had a woman body.
If you're seeing the brain, you can see that the brain consists of two national pollinators.
Thank you for a minute. Thank you very much. It was fun. (Applause: Right)
Now, the information that happened to energy has been spread to all the sensational systems at the same time, shows how the memory looks, how it rains, how it feels, and how it sounds.
We're a energy that's connected to the energy that's around us through the right brain.
And at that point, we're perfect, full and look forward.
But the left brain is a completely different place.
The left half is a methodic idea.
And the left brain thinks in any language.
The only thing I can was external energy — power.
"And I say, ""What do you see me?"
I feel the surface in my body. Thank you.
