I was 11 years old. I remember at a morning, as a sign that I played in my house to hear the sounds of joy.
My father heard the news of the BBC at a little bit in the radio.
And there was a mutilation that we didn't have been habituated at that time, because the news actually led it.
"I said, ""It was taken back to the Taliban."" My father was crying."
I didn't understand what it means, but I knew how happy my father was.
"Now, ""You can go to the real school,"" he said my father."
It was a morning I couldn't know.
Right to go to school.
I've been six years old when I had a school for girls who went to Afghanistan.
So, in the last five years, I had to go as a boy to go to the secret school, and I had to try my father who had been prohibited to leave her alone.
And that's the only way we can't get education.
We've gone on a different way every day that nobody should be concerned about where we go.
We put our books into the market boxes, just because we're going to shop.
The school was inside a house, more than 100 people were embedded in a little room.
It was easy in winter, but it would be terrible.
Teachers, teachers and parents — we all knew we could risk our lives.
Sometimes, for the Taliban suspects, the school was connected a week.
We've always been afraid of what we know.
Do they look at us?
Do they know what we live here?
We were scared, but again, school was the place we wanted to be.
I was really lucky because I grew up in a family that deserves education, and I grew up in a couple of girls.
My father was a high human because of his age.
And there's a different thought that lived in a poor place of Afghanistan, and the girl, the mother, went to school, and so she was rejected by his father's childhood.
But my mother was a teacher.
It's cool.
Two years ago, he went out to school, and he turned our home into a school for girls and women in the neighborhood.
And my father — that's the first difference that he learned in his family.
And there was no doubt that his daughters were going to get education, but they had to look at risks, despite the dangers of the Taliban.
So it's more dangerous when kids don't learn.
In the Taliban years, it's coming, it's time, it's life, it's always in fear, and it's not going to see light from the future.
"And my hand came out of everything, and my father said, ""Hey, my daughter, you can lose everything in your life."
You can be a pollen-paran boy. You can put a place to leave your house inside the wars.
But the only thing that's going to stay with you is here, and if we have to sell your blood to pay your school charges, and we'll send you to school.
"Well, you're trying to continue?"" Now I can't get 22 years old."
I grew up in a country that was disseminated in a war for decades.
I could only end a half percent of my parents, and if my family didn't go so much after my education, I didn't see it.
In fact, I'm standing here as a Middlebury Collection that's lost around you.
(Applause) When we returned to the village, one of the first people who celebrated me was my father who sent her girl to school.
He's not because I'm a prison, but because I'm the first woman I'm going to go with a car in the rooms of Kabil.
(Applause) My family believe me.
I have great trips, and my family's journey is bigger for me.
So I'm a leader of a global campaign for women called 10x10.
So, in a country where women are still risked to go to school, I'm from the makers of the SOLA, the first dormant school in Afghanistan.
And the most of the hope is that I see students who are able to benefit from the opportunities in my school.
And I see how parents, my father, my father, they're supporting their daughters, despite all those who are confronted with me.
I can't tell you the surface and the true name, but he's a father of one of my students.
Approximately a month ago, when she went from Sola to the village, he spent a few minutes from dying in a bomb crash outside the road.
When he came home, he took the phones, and the voice on the phone, while she continued to send her girl to school, he had to get back to the explosion.
"And he said, ""If you want, then kill me,"" he said, ""But I'm not going to worry about what my daughter's going to come back because you're tired and courageous thinking."" Now, what I've discovered about Afghanistan, sometimes the fact that the Westers are looking forward to — that everyone who's looking forward to death is to sustain the value of a girl who thinks he's successful."
This doesn't mean that our mothers don't open our success.
In fact, the majority of the analogy that parents believe and guide girls' light, but in a community like in Afghanistan, men's group is lost.
In the Taliban, the number of girls who went to school was measured by hundreds — as you know, it was said to the southwest.
But now, more than three million girls who go to school in Afghanistan.
(Applause) It looks very different when Afghanistan looks from America.
I'm aware of what Americans see in the changes.
I'm afraid that these changes will be taken very long after the U.S. military.
But when I went to Afghanistan and went to school, when I saw the validity of the children and their support and their spiritual convictions, I grew up with a bright future and a constant change.
I think Afghanistan's a country of hope and unlimited opportunities, and girls who read in the SOLA, don't give me a more every day.
And they're making a great journey like me.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
It's really fascinating, at all fluctuations.
It's lost in Afghanistan.
It doesn't fly. We're going to go back.
One. Two. Three.
When you see the first social event.
It was a suspicion about anything.
In fact, as I know, I was very lucky, many South Korea didn't have been so lucky.
He learned a new language, and after he got a job, he could make all the lives down a little bit.
We all were Korean, but we were 67 years old, after the division.
I'm South Korea or South Korea?
So I started planning how to save them.
Someone I don't know.
That's the symbol of my life at that time.
It's a kind of connection that we've designed in 2007.
We hit it in the form of space.
It's going to hit the period without standing on the door of the building.
If you're a gentleman, you know that kids love rain.
So the roof of the building looks like this.
Why did we look like this?
"And the other director said to me, ""I don't want to be a sir.""
"And I said to him, ""It's impossible."" But he asked, ""How do you look at the outside of my mother?"
"You're going to go up with kids."" (Laughter) I said to him, ""No."" Of course, the government workers said, ""The poor should have.""
We applied the idea of that tor, but around the trees.
There are three trees inside the building.
And they allowed us to call these screws.
But it's used for another purpose.
They're collisioned on the tower.
Kids are collisioned when they're crying.
(Laughter) Sometimes, some of the kids around a trees collect about 40 years.
This boy's flower that you see in Buda likes so much that she eat it.
(Laughter) When they're doing any event, they're sitting outside the door.
It looks pretty beautiful down here.
They're reading the garage to the mosquitos.
(Laughter) It's time to eat.
(Laughter) (Applause) We've bought the shower as possible because we want to see kids not just under the shower, but on top.
If the ceiling is very high, it's only possible to see the ceiling.
And it's a place to eat a foot — every kind of water crater.
What you can see is that the dragonflies are playing when you want to cook friends, and it's a dragonflies, and it's normal.
But the boy you're seeing is carrying them with a crane, filling them with water.
(Laughter) It's completely open for the majority of the year.
There's no insect from inside and outside.
And that means that the arxectura is basically made of the roof.
There's no surface between the scales.
There are no acoustic ways.
Most of the kids begin to begin to begin to begin to begin with the pain.
But there's no reason to figure out in this connection.
Because there's no place here.
The police says that if the boy who's sitting on the corner, he can go out if he doesn't want to stay in the room.
It's in the cave, and it's going to go back.
(Laughter) So, I'd say, in this way, kids really like to hide.
And here are they going and they're going back.
And that's a natural process.
Second, we think it's very important to be sound.
You know that kids sleep better at the voice.
They don't sleep at the heart.
In our context, children show high concentration at school.
You know that our sons grow in the wrong.
They need a voice.
You know that you can't easily talk to your friends and listen to the voice on the floor.
You don't have to be able.
You know, at the end, we're trying to control everything.
But it's completely open.
I'm sure we can fly in the winter at a temperature of 20 degrees.
And we're going to go on the surface.
We're solar in the surface of 50 degrees.
We don't pass water.
We're married at rain.
So we've been created to be here.
And so we have to act with kids.
And here they're trying to share the sinifi.
They have to help their teachers.
But they don't do.
(Laughter) Now, this kid gets into itself.
So this is the seat room.
And that's a hand-out.
They talk well here.
Many of the hotels have trees.
It's trying to keep the mango on the top of the bottom.
(Laughter) You're a lot more. (Laughter)
There's a window on the floor of every class room.
And that's the year when the Noel comes from here.
And it's a extra wire, built on the right side of the interior wire.
It's about five meters above, and it's seven places.
It's because it's a lot of shopping.
We have to think about security.
We allow a girl to study.
They're trying to get inside.
It's worth.
It's good, but it's hard.
He's my son. He's my son.
(Laughter) Here he's looking at how safe it's to get out of the trees.
And then we left the other kids inside.
You know it's a lot of gravity in Tokyo.
(Laughter) It's trying to learn how the driver goes on.
In the last time, kids need a little bit of danger.
In those cases, they learn to help each other.
It's a community, and we're giving these kinds of opportunities.
This patch shows the movement of a kid from 9.10 to 9.30.
It's 183 meters.
It's not a little bit.
So this little morning, six thousand meters across.
But the interesting thing is still ahead.
In this connection, kids move about four,000 meters per day.
Kids here have the highest atletic indicators between the connections.
"The other minister always says, ""I don't teach them. They're just like the speed of birds."
"We're going to go on the floor."" (Laughter) They're going to go for themselves. (Laughter)"
I think we don't need to control them and protect them, but they have to get out of all.
They have to take little attention.
Because we teach them how to live in life.
I think the heritage is able to change the world and the lives of people.
This is one of the steps taken to change the lives of kids.
Thank you.
(Applause)
In the 1970s, I worked with gymnastics for two years in China in Hunan.
When I read in the first class, I gave me a proposal that all the costs would be paid by the government to go to the atletic school.
"But my grandmother said, ""No."" My parents wanted me to become engineers like them."
One of the things that happened after the reform of the economy was that the only way to get good and secure jobs to be happy.
I don't love my work so important.
But my desire was to become a Chinese Opera artist.
So I'm going to draw my journey piano.
You have to work with akrobatics from young years to be an Opera artist, and I went out of my hand to get to the Opera school.
I also wrote a letter to our school teachers to make a radio show.
But the adults didn't like me.
Nobody believed I was serious.
But my friends supported me that they were amazing kids like me.
So when I was 15 years old, I realized it was night to train.
My desire never was real.
I was afraid that I'm going to be the only happiness that I'm going to get the second grade as the end of my life.
But it was unfair.
I decided to find another way.
Nobody's going to show me the way? Yes. No.
I asked books.
"I asked this book that was written by my music family to replace the advice of Valide, and I learned that I was able to read it from this book, and if I asked a woman to have the tradition of Confute, I took the free woman model from this. [" Jean Eyr."" And I learned that I was able to be able to read this book."" The world is actually called ""Sheaper by the Dozen"" And these books helped me to read abroad."
"[""[""The Sanmao's works community"" (here called Echo Chan)] [""It's a writer: Nan Huaijin,"" What did I read the first books when we came to the U.S. in 1995?"
Of course, books prohibited in China.
""The rich Torpaq"" is about the Chinese village."
There's no benefit for the Propaq. I'm going to do it.
The Bible is interesting, and it's a little bizarre.
(Laughter) It's the theme of another day.
"But my fifth couple brought me light, and I said, ""You'll honor the father and the mother.""
"I thought, ""Laughter"" ""Well, it's different and better."" So I got the chance to restore my relationship with my parents from a part of the sins in the Connecticut."
And it gave me the opportunity to compare what I read with the new culture.
It can teach you a lot of things.
For example, this map saw me amazing at the beginning, because in China we grew up by learning this map.
I never thought that China wasn't supposed to be in the center of the world.
In fact, the map shows the world's look.
There's no new thing with the original story.
It's a standard practice in the science world.
But there's also a field of science, like comparative religion and comparative literature.
Art and reconciliation helps scientists understand the whole matter.
And I thought that if you're working for comparative science, why don't you make it in your everyday life?
So I started to read books in the case of dragonflies.
"And let's say, people who are involved in the same event are about the friends who are involved with ""Benjamin Franklin,"" Walter Isaacson, ""John Adams,"" or David McCullough."
"[""The Story Story"" writer: Katharine Graham] [Laughter: Warren Buffett and Life" writer: Alice Schroeder] I love to read a story compared to a few January — (Laughter) [Laughter: The King James version] [Laughter] [Laughter: Christopher Moore] Or Joseph Campbell describes the same stories in different cultures as he did in his beautiful era."" Joseph Campbell, a writer: Joseph Campbell, misal; for Jesus and every two of the prophets and every two of Budha, they had lost three dragonflies."
For Jesus' prophet, these were economic, political and spiritual.
It's interesting for you that they're all psychological: fatigue, fear and social fatigue.
If you know foreign language, it's interesting to read books in two languages.
"The writer, ""Chuang Tzu Yolu,"" Thomas Merton, ""Tao: The Earth."" Alan Watts, I found not the loss of my mind, but other interesting facts."
"So, with the help of translations, I realized that happiness in China means ""happy happiness.""
"The word coming in Chinese is defined as ""the mother." Yeah!""
(Laughter) The books play a magic website that I can connect with people in the past and in India.
I don't know that I'm going to be just or ridiculous again.
Your desire is nothing compared to the difficulty of others.
I started to believe that the only purpose of the desire is not to realize.
The key goal of the desire is to connect us with the point of desire, of happiness and of happiness.
And the unexpected desire is able to do it.
Because books are because I'm here today and I'm happy. And I'm very often living with a clear purpose.
"I'm telling you, ""The books are always with you.""
Thank you.
(Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)
You didn't say it. What did you do.
"The person is looking at his room, and you asked, ""What's my room?"" Well, it's Friday morning, and you're in office, and one of you look at a meeting on your agenda."
And I'm talking about something more valuable than the office device.
From time, from your time.
(Laughter sounds) You don't think, the key sign of the dispute syndrome is to accept the invitation to a meeting in the calendar. (Laughter sounds)
"It's a wonderful reflective — I'm, click, dictionary — in your schedule, ""I'm going to go, I'm waiting for the meeting."" (Laughter sounds) Words are important, right?"
Friendship is the opening of a journey in every company.
And a meeting that goes right can actually lead to a significant result.
We're crying. (Laughter) That's not because he doesn't have a good meeting, but the DRS, the Rational Syndrome, we create itself.
In fact, I think DRS is a global epidemic.
So I'm talking to you.
So, a few years ago, I put a video on YouTube, and I've felt a very bad confrontation that you could have in this video.
This is about five minutes video unifies everything we hate about bad meetings.
The observer of a meeting that doesn't control the class, here.
Participants who don't know why they're.
And he left all of them in a kind of fun way.
It's a challenge to smile.
(Laughter) Let's look fast.
(Video) Now, our goal is to understand a very important issue.
Hello, Joe. I'm working home today.
(Laughter) Hello Joe. Thank you for your attention.
As a group — ding dong — (Laughter) Salam, who was involved?
No? Do you say to me that. (Laughter) Do you know?
Yes, they're also familiar with me.
A few weeks after you put it on YouTube, 500,000 people from hundreds of countries, really from hundreds of countries, looked at this video.
And three years later, this video is looking for thousands of times a month.
Even the kids who don't see, laugh when they hear people's voice.
"I'm Michael Shermer. I'm born a skeptic magazine, a director of the Society of skeptic."
We study the arguments about paranormal events, psevdo-elm, interested groups and külts. These are science, psevdo-elm, non-alm, tullant science, wudu-elm, telepathy science, bad science, and that's what's incomprehensible.
If you're living at Mars last time, then you're often confronted with these things.
Some people call us a crater in negative sense.
But let's say, car capture has a lot of things.
We're as a police department, and we find them, and we're like Ralph Neydry. (Laughter) We want to change bad ideas with good things.
I'm going to show you a example of a bad idea.
I've done it with myself. It gives us to explore the NBC TV.
"It's going to produce a company of ""Quadro"" in North Virginia."
"It's called ""Quadro 2000 Explorer.""
(Laughter) They've sold it to school leaders for 900 dollars.
It's a plastic thing that's placed on the radio shack antenne.
It can be used to look for a lot of things from the search engine devices, but it's important to look at marijuana in the cafeteria of the student.
(Laughter) It works like this: If you're going to go back to the box when you're in the corridor, you're open the coffee.
That's something.
I'm going to show you.
(Laughter) Hm. It's a little fruit to go right.
So we're going to study again because we're scientific.
We believe it's going to go to this side.
(Laughter) Lord, if you don't have respect, you'll push your cows. (Laughter)
Of course, the primary question is: can this tool find the marijuana in the mosquitos?
And the key is, yes, if you open a coffee enough, you can find it.
(Laughter) (Applause) We should not only follow what we're found in science, but also follow what we don't find.
And the point that gives me a short point here is, of course, that's the equations, astrologists and the outlets always use it.
They remember what people find, they don't find.
We note everything in science. We compare the number of the most visible and objective found.
So here we've done this.
We took two boxes, one of the official records of THC, and one of them left out.
And about 50 percent of the tests were successful. (Laughter) We're going to take this result when we're a chef father.
This was a interesting, small example about what we've done.
The ""Skeptic"" magazine is published for three months, and every article is a subject."
It's about the future of poverty.
So when people go, they're conscious or not?
And I'm going forward to this, and I have some idea about it, and it's what people think when they're going.
Every decade, average IQ increases three numbers.
It's interesting.
Don't think skeptic or scientific material.
Are science and religion in harmone?
It's what to question the harmonicity of the health cabinet with science.
These are two different things.
It's not science education, it's activity.
It's hard to think about things.
Natural explanations for all the events are the way to accelerate.
"What's more real? What's the way of the Earth's stars or multitasking beings, away from another galaxy, making the farm Bob's cabinet in Canada for a sceptic.com advertisement?"
"Or someone of the ""Skeptic"" readers would make it with ""Photoshop""?"
And the question is, anyway, what definition is more real.
Before we say that something is alive in another world, we have to believe that it's not from this world.
"What's more real? Will Arnold help the astronauts to be a cyborg? Or does the World Weekly News fly it?"
(Laughter) So things like this were found in the cartoon of Sydney Harris.
"I read for those who go in the archipelago, ""Now there's a wonderful thing."
"Well, you're going to explain the second pill better."" It's devastating all the smart designs."
That's what this cartoon does.
(Applause) You can say you're going to start. But it doesn't explain anything. I don't think about it.
There's nothing to do.
It's the end of the conversation for the designers of the smart design.
In order to pay the sources, scientists sometimes call extraordinary things like dark energy, dark matter, until they understand what it's, they're called this.
It's the beginning of the mind window for science.
And for smart design designers, it's the end of the window.
The same question is again. What's more real?
Is UFO the machine of asteroids, or is the cloud of gravity, or the cloud of gravity?
It's a picture of a UFO taken from my home from California to Pasan.
It's reading this piece, right? Because it's a piece.
"It doesn't need ""Photoshop," high technology, computer."
"I've taken this picture with the code instamatic device."
Nobody got a sticker on the hand outside.
The camera was ready — so much.
(Laughter) You can think some of them are real, even if they're holding a lot of them or illusions, but the big chance is that they're all missing.
And if we take more general, we're always looking for a line between evidence and theory.
For example, when the Hubble's telescope drives to Saturn, there were two problems.
First, there was no theory about planetary galaxies.
Second, let's hold the witnesses, and we're not able to understand exactly what they saw.
"And he wrote his eyes like this: "I noticed that the distant planet was made of three bodies.""
He decided that it was what he saw.
So you can't form good theory with the good planetary universe without the theory of the wrong data.
It's so until 1655.
It's a page of a book that Christian Huygens has collected the dragonflies that people who are doing to understand Saturn.
These two things were known to Huygens, and there was a good theory about planetary galaxies and the solar system, and there was more precise telescope data, so we realized that the Kepler rules would hit Earth faster than Saturn.
We could see the wall of the galaxy with this telescope.
And that's the idea of theory.
The poor part of the theory is that it can be full of science puzzles.
One of the reasons why we believe in the bizarre is that we just have and understand, and then I'm going to touch the serious reasons.
We were eager to see the surface everywhere.
It's going on in Mars.
In 1966, NASA wanted to take other pictures of the same place, and people thought that it was in a woman created by marveles.
It's a picture taken close in 2001.
If you cut your eyes, you can put your face again.
When you're close your eyes, you're turning the precise image into a more invisible image, so you're slowing down the quality of data.
And if I'm not going to say you have to look at the floor, you've seen the surface because we've been adapted to recognize the surface.
The eyes are important for us from social view.
And, of course, they're smiling. It's easy to see every kind of surface.
You're seeing a smile on Mars here.
(Laughter) If astronomers were built, they would also see the Kermiti in the Qur'an.
Look. Have you ever seen the dragonflies of a little bit?
Or if they were geologists.
Religious icons.
(Laughter) In 1996, he found a crater in Tenessee.
He took five dollars from those who wanted to see the gravity. That's the fact that Rahib had access to news from the village of Terez.
Here's Guadalupe and Watsonville, down to the bottom. Is it small on the top?
It's very good for this, because it's fresh, bullful, white, white and white, and it's like you see these pictures on the surface — people are the animals that look like a picture.
This is the mirror of the Look at the window outside the door in Sao Paul.
Here, I'm looking at this, and I'm going to show it in a peninsula, and I'm going to touch it in a garage in Las Vegas. Yes, here's America.
(Laughter) The casino paid 28 500 dollars to buy this sender from eBay. (Laughter)
So you think who's reading here? (Laughter)
And the dragonflies were collisioned, which was in the sky of the 1940s.
I'm going to look at Clearwater in Florida.
I went to myself to see it.
There was a lot of people.
It's a very faithful person who came with the real cars, with the dragonflies.
And we've been interested closer.
So if you know the dimension, this is Dawkins, I and my wonderful Randi, we're standing on the face of two, two, a half-dimensional surface.
In respect of people, thousands of dragonflies ran.
We went and looked at the back to understand what happened.
You say, there's a picture where there's a phontane and palm trees.
And that's the picture of my eye on the other side. They started to look.
Nevertheless, most of a building can be a wonderful.
(Laughter) Now, it's really wonderful, or is the Marge wonderful? (Laughter)
So I'm going to take another example about it, and I'm going to finish my head with the sort of illusions.
There's a film called ""Laughter,"" and Maykl Kiton is playing, and the dead tells us to talk."
When we come to the Earth, talking to the dead doesn't really matter so much.
It seems to be able to tell everyone.
It's the answer of the dead that's hard.
(Laughter) In this movie, these messages are hidden in electronic events.
I upload them from a website called ReverseSpeech.com.
It's the most famous.
It's a beautiful sound of that famous voice.
(Laughter) If you're older, don't worry.
May Kenyan's writing is clean.
If two ways are separate, it's time to change the way.
Now, listen to the translation. Do you hear a hidden message in the word here?
(Music and unprecedented words) [Satan] — Satan
(Music and unprecedented words) What did you hear? Recorder: The Devil!
Satan? You can't hear the little bit of the satan.
Now I'm going to say what you need to hear to listen to the part of your brain, and we'll hear again.
I'm going to end with a little, beautiful and meaningful story.
""Skeptics"" is an unprofit organization."
We're always looking for good things that people are doing.
There's a pop museum in England.
Now it's very popular in England: it's called Katie Melu.
There's a very famous audience.
"It was between the best five songs in 2005, and it's called ""50 million bicycles in Beijing."" It's a love story — Norah Jones in Britain, which is the fact that he loved his son is very much like at about a million bicycles."
There's a part of it in words.
(Music) (Laughter) We're 12 billion light years away. It's a galaxy. Nobody can say that's right. But I can say that I'm going to live with you for a lifetime.
Spiker: Yeah. It's at least the nearest number.
"It would be in America, ""We're six thousand light years away."" (Laughter) My friend Simon Singh, a gravitational physicist. It's a scientific pedographer, and it's the author of the book ""The Great Partition."" It's worth all the opportunity to promote good science."
"So, in the Guardian, he wrote a article about the story of Katie, and he said, we know exactly how far we're away from the probe."
We're 12 not, 13,7 billion light years away, and it's not sure.
We know exactly how much it's possible if it's a little bit of damage.
So, if we're not completely correct, we can say that it's very close to the right number.
The surprise is that after the publication of his article, Katie asked him, and he said, I was very hateful, I was a member of the astronomical club.
I had to take this way, and she wrote it.
And I'm going to end my mind with this.
(Music words) We've been 13,7 billion light years away from the boundaries of the universe that we know to be a customer.
It might be a real advantage, but it's the nearest number that's determined.
And in terms of information in our hands, I predict that I'll always be together with you.
(Laughter) Well, right?
(Applause)
In the 1980s, if you have a written machine in the eastern Germany, you have to pass it from registration.
The example of a text that was written in the machine had to be recorded.
So the government knew the source of all the books.
When they found a paper that invented a moral thought, they could find the writer of that thought.
And we've calculated something like this in the Western as a huge damage to the freedom of expression.
We didn't allow it in our own countries.
But today, in 2012, if you take a laser print device of any famous mark, you'll print something on each page, you'll print the yellow points of the left, which's just in your printer, and the yellow points that will differentiate from others.
It's the reality of today.
Nobody doesn't put it.
This is an example of our government's technology that uses us to our own citizens.
This is one of the three major online problems.
And when we look at online problems, we see online attacks that are made by certain groups.
These attackers are divided into three major groups.
The first is online criminals.
In this way, it's like Dmitri Kolubov, who's from the Kyev city of Ukraine.
And it's not hard to understand why online criminals lose crime.
These people get money.
Most of them, actually, are online attacks to get a lot of money.
In fact, we've seen millions of people who have millions of millions, millioners on the Internet.
It's Vladimir Tsasts from the city of Tartu in Estonia.
This is Alfred Gonzalez.
This is Stephen Watt.
This is Bjorn Sundin.
It's Matthew Anderson and Tariq Al-Dawour. It's also possible to extend the black.
These people earn their services online, but they're doing it by extraordinary ways, and when we operate online, they use things like a banking virus to pay money from our banking accounts, or when we buy a virus online, they collect credit card data with a key reader software.
Two months ago, the U.S. secret service organ, named Sam Jain, had a account in the Swiss bank, and it had 14,9 million US dollars in the liquidation.
But nobody knows that Sam Je's right now.
I think today, the chance of being a criminally victims on the Internet is greater than the real world.
And it seems clearly that when the situation goes, it's even worse.
In the future, the big circle of crimes will start online.
The second big group of on-line attackers are not money because they're doing this.
The reasons why they're trying to see this could be protest, freedom of mind, smile.
The groups like Anonymous have grown in the last year, and they've started to keep the main place in online atrocks.
And I calculated two of the three main attackers: these are criminals that work for money, such as the hackers who protest. The third major force is the government and the governments.
Let's look at those that are happening in companies like DigiNotar.
It's a baric example of what governments are doing when they attack their citizens.
It's a certificate discovery in DigiNotar in Holland — that's more true.
In our last year, they've been worried about their online cells.
Nobody went into the systems and the whole system broke out.
And in a refugee last week, I asked the Dutch government ministers, and I asked one of the government ministers, and I didn't believe that it was the human death of DigiNotar.
He said he believed.
Why are people dying by such an attack?
DigiNotar is an online certificate organization.
They sell online certificate.
What do they do with the certificate?
If you have a website based on https, and if you want to use the SSL encryption service, you need this certificate.
We use more than Gmail or read goods, but it's more popular in countries like Iran as a totalitary regime. In these countries, the leaders use more than the foreign services like Gmail, because they don't control local government emails than they're encrypted as a SSL code.
But this surveillance, the external certificate that offers such services.
It's possible by distributing the website of the companies.
And that was what happened to the DigiNotar company.
What about the Arab Sea and what happens in the Misirians?
In the mission, in April 2011, the prisoners invented the center of the Secret Police of Mission, and they invented a lot of documentary records looking for it.
"In these papers, there was a benefit from ""FinFISHER."" And in this case, there were records of a smart company in Germany. The company bought tools and apps to the government of Mission to keep citizens all of the means of communication under surveillance."
These tools were sold to the Misiri government to 280,000 Europeans.
The center of the company is all here.
In the meantime, the Western governments provide it with devices that allow the totalitary governments to control their citizens.
But the Western governments do this for their citizens.
For example, a few weeks ago, there was a virus called the State Virus in Germany, which was created three to investigate his citizens by the German government.
If you're wrong with a little bit of gravity, it's obvious that your phone is heard.
Now, it's already about it.
They're going to follow your Internet connection.
By conducting the government virus to your computer, you can control all your relationships, listen to your online conversations, they can learn your encryptions.
"So many people who talk about things like this, probably, say, ""Laughter, it's not a good job, but I'm a civil who is a law, it doesn't have a lot of impact on me."
Why are I worried?
"I don't have anything wrong."" But it's a very poor idea."
The privacy is a condition.
It's not about music.
It doesn't matter with the choice between security and nature.
It's based on a choice between security and surveillance.
And this is what we believe in our government today in the year 2011, and if we're able to reject our rights.
But can we believe in our eyes with our government in the future, the next 50 years?
And questions and questions like this should have to worry about us in the next 50 years.
(Music) (Applause) Thank you because you're here.
"And I say, ""Thank you for you here,"" because I was in a cave for 17 years."
And I said these first things, the 20th anniversary of the Earth's day, held in Washington DC.
My family and my friends were hit up to listen to me.
"And I said, ""I'm a prisoner because you're here,"" And my mother said, ""He speaks to Halley, Johnny.""
(Laughter) Imagine what you're sitting in a cave for 17 years, and imagine your mother's kind of life behavior.
"My mother said to me, ""It's the only."" I'll understand it."
I looked at it because I didn't understand what my voice came from the wall.
"I didn't hear my voice for 17 years, and I looked around me and said, "God, who is what I think?""
And then I realized that this is my self and my smile.
"My mother said, ""Yes, he's going to go out of the cave."" Now I want to take you into this journey."
But despite the exception of this journey, it's all of us.
I believe you can be a metaphor for our journey, and I want you to never think about your journey.
My journey started in 1971, when I witnessed the collision of two oil tankers under Golden Gate, then a half million galaxies of oil exploded.
It really affected me so much that I decided to use engineering transport tools.
It's a big thing for California.
This was also a big thing for the small Point Reyes station I lived in Inverness, where 350 people lived in the winter of 71-year.
And when I came here, I started to walk on the piano, people — they knew what happened.
"They said, ""John, what do you do?"" And I said, ""I'm going on a piano for a dark environment,"" They said, ""Well, you're doing it to hate us, right?"
"You're doing it to do it so that you're not going to make you bad."" Maybe they were true, and I thought that when I walk on the ped, people would join me."
Because it's all of the oil that's in the ocean.
He spoke, and I was talking to people who didn't stay in this case.
I asked my parents.
"And I said, ""I don't use cars."" My father said, ""Why did you do this when you were 16 years old?"" (Laughter) I didn't know about the environment at that time."
They lived in Philadelphia.
"I said to my mother, ""I'm very happy, I'm very happy."" And he said, ""If you're crazy, you don't need to tell it anything."" So, my mother."
So, at my 27th birthday, I decided that — because I had a lot of questions, and I talked so much — I decided that I had to talk, but I had a day, a day stage.
So I did that.
I didn't even talk about a stroke when I went out of the morning.
And I'm saying that this was a wonderful experience for me because I started to listen so long for the first time.
And when I heard, it caused me to think.
Because I always thought I was listening to people, and when I listened to people, I thought they wanted to talk about what they wanted to say, I didn't listen to them anymore.
And when I spoke to people, I went forward to them, and I thought about what they're going to say when they're talking.
And then ...
So the communication ended up.
And that day I really heard.
And that was a question for me because I realized that I didn't learn something in these years.
I was 27 years old, and I thought I knew everything.
But I didn't know.
So I study it for the next day, and then again and this time, and I said to me, I'm in a prison for a year because I started to learn, and I needed it.
So I didn't talk for a year, and then I thought in my day, I might start to talk again about some things I learned.
But it took 17 years.
I went to the piano for 17 years, and I worked on the bank, and I worked on writing my work and my day. I tried to study the real engineering book.
And I thought I needed to get education.
I went to Ashland, Oregon, and there were education apps around them.
800 kilometers away.
I went to the award office, and what? What?
I've shown the message in the magazine.
Okay, you want to read here when you're born?
Have you ever heard?
We have a special software for you. They're doing it.
And after two years, I ended up with the rate of breeding.
My father came. He gave me a gift.
"He said, ""Hey, my son, we honor you, but we don't know what it's going to do with this master degree."
"You're not driving a car, you're not talking, you're going to do it."" (Laughter) I've taken my flower and taken my pocket and I started to go back."
I came to Port Townsend, Washington, and I went back here from the trees, and I moved it through Puget Sound from Idaho to Washington, and here I moved to Missoula, Montana.
Two years ago, I asked the University of Montana, and I was looking forward to this.
It wasn't bad to stay there for two years.
(Laughter) And that happened. I've been studying at the University for two years. The village showed me a lot of help.
There's two stories around Montana.
The first thing is that when we arrived here, my money lost.
"And they said, ""Don't worry about it,"" The Director of the program said, ""Come back in the morning."" He gave me 150 dollars, and he said, ""Go out for a lesson."
"You go to South America, right?"" I said to him — Sky and stars, hydrogen systems, South America."
So I did that.
"He came back and said to me, ""Ok, John, you can use the library as a student, taking the office open for a lesson."
But we'll allow you all of the teachers to participate in their class.
"Let's be easy to take a lot of money, and the rest of the matter, and then you can take a lot of money."" Yes, it doesn't be done in the Supreme Court."
They wanted to help me, and I was great.
They saw that there's a lot of things in the environment, and they tried to help me on this way.
And in this period, I've taken the instructions without talking.
When I first went to school, I had 13 students.
He translated my friend to them with the hand signals: John Francis, I walk on the piano, and I told them that it's not going to be translated — that's the last lesson.
All of the students that are going on.
(Laughter) I saw the winds of time to get out of the surface.
But I had to tell them that image.
Two weeks later, everyone tried to go into our village.
I learned a lot of things in this school — when I did these kinds of actions.
He got all up with his head to say what John works to say — I don't know, I think that the trees are slammed. Yes, the trees are slammed.
Not, not. It's not — it's the use of the hand screws.
You're someone with a hand movement.
You can actually get someone.
Not, he's talking about the selection engineering.
So this was a sign of discussion, and we talked about it.
I've taken back from that job and say, I've gone away.
But something I learned happened. And when they showed a sign, they sounded the sense that I didn't fully predict, but I didn't even predict it.
And I thought that if you're teaching and teaching, and if you don't learn yourself, you don't learn well.
So I continued.
"He came to my father and my grandmother said to me and my father, ""We're giving you, but you know."" And you know, ""You have to drive and talk to the car."
"What are you going to do with the Master's degree?"" I took my Chinese, threw my cabinet and went to the University of Wisconsin."
And I went there for two years, writing about oil tolls.
Nobody wasn't interested in oil carriers.
But something happened — Exxon Valdez.
And I was a man who wrote about oil tolls in the U.S.
My father came again.
"He said, ""I don't know how this does, ""You don't use the machine, you don't talk."
"My father said, ""You have to leave you, because you're looking forward to better things."" (Laughter) I got my box back to me."
I took my bathroom, and I went to the eastern coast, and I went my feet to the Atlantic Ocean, and it took seven years and a day to go to the U.S. front of it.
And in 1990, I started to blow the Earth's Earth in the 20th century of the Sun.
So I've noticed those dragonflies because there's no one who heard that when the trees were falling on the floor, then it's not a voice.
And I thank the hosts and my family because they came to listen to me.
And that's the connection.
And they taught me to listen — they heard me.
And that's something that doesn't come from that cluster — listening to each other.
It's really important — we need to listen to each other.
My journey continued.
"My mother said, ""It's the only,"" and I didn't have done it."
I've worked as a Saharan Guard, and I've been the Supreme Head of the U.N.
I wrote rules for the U.S. — rules for oil tolls.
"20 years ago, if someone said to me, "John, you want to make a difference from the birth?""
"Yeah, I'd like to make a difference."
"And they said, ""Come on the right place, go out of the car and start on the right place."" And after a few places, they said, ""Well, you eat it."" (Laughter) My friend, you want to separate.""
How does that happen? Why?
How can it be different with simple things like to go and talk?
The desert preservation period was beautiful.
"And then — I worked here for just a year — I said, ""Well, it's a year enough to do this."" I went back to the Caribbean, and I went to Venecuela, and I went to all the villages of the army."
The key thing came out — I'd like to tell you why I started to talk to you.
I started to talk, and I learned the environment engineering.
I've learned the environment engineering at this level — formally, but there was a non-formal surface.
And the non-formal surveillance was what I learned about people, what we do and we're not doing.
And the environment is not only because of trees and birds, but not for the species that are dangerous, but because of our adaptation to each other.
And if we're around, we're looking at all around us and see our behavior to ourselves and each other.
And that was the inventor I wanted to transmit.
"And I said, ""I'm going to transmit this inventor to others," and I'm sitting in the loop of the Caribbean — that was my own source, and I worked on it — I went to Venus and I started to travel."
It's the end of this story, and I realized that I couldn't come there because I didn't use the car.
I went through El Dorado — here's a famous prison city or a prison prison — in Venezuela, and I don't know what happened to me because I wasn't in myself.
"And when he went through the customs room, he took me and said, ""Applause, passport"" and M16 brought me down."
"And I said to me, ""Well, passport?"
I'm not going to show you a pass, but it's my cabinet.
I'm going to Sri Lanka, Dr. Francis, and I'm going around the world, and I left the rate.
What caused me to say that?
And the way went to prison.
They didn't smile me.
I was liberated, and I thank God because I was liberated. What do I say?
When I went 150 kilometers on the road, I realized that I was in my dream, and I was turned into a space.
I was in prison and I had to fly out there.
I didn't use military transport tools was a prison that I was inside.
What happens?
Because when I started, he looked like it was suitable for me to use the car.
But the difference was that I've ever asked myself to look at every day, but I never wanted to use my feet.
That's why I'm going to be the U.N.
I didn't have to be a professor.
And so I realized that I had other responsibilities than myself, and so I had to change.
You know, we can do it.
I was trying to change.
And I was scared of change because I always learned to go and go.
Because I learned to a prison who didn't want the end.
I didn't know who I would be when I went.
But I knew that was necessary.
I knew that I didn't change, because it was the way to be here today.
And I know that we're very often at a place where we want to stay forever, but there's other places to go for us.
And we have to go to the place where we're going to have a new person and keep the stability of our own person now.
And I want to thank you to go to that next place — take you out of the prison where you can't go inside, so it's so easy that it's possible. We have to do something on this path today.
We have to change.
We have to be happy, as our President of Greece said.
And if my voice affects you, if I'm affected you if I'm living, if I'm affected you if I'm here, I ask you to do it.
I know that when I'm here, you can all impact me.
Let's go on the sky — go out of the world, take this love, take this respect with us — here's the relationship we show each other at TED when we're born with ourselves.
Because we're the environment engineer and our mutual behavior means our behavior in our environment.
So, because you're here, I'm going to remind you, and I'm going to finish my performance for five seconds.
Thank you.
(Applause)
"I'm sure, if you stay in any small size in America, a plant gets closer to you and asks, "Well, what's the name of this block?""
"And you say, ""It's a little Oak, and it's a little science."
"It's 26th, and he's 27th."" He says, ""Well, what's the name of this block?"" You say, ""No block's called."
"It's called little ones, the blocks are just a non-profit country between little ones."" He's looking for you in a little crazy and devastating way."
"And let's imagine that if you stay in a little bit in Germany, you're going to tell me, ""Well, what's the name of this little?""
"He says, ""This block is 17 and the number of that block is 16,"" And you say, ""What's the name of what's the size?"" He says, ""There are no names of boys."
They're called blocks.
Look at Google Maps. There are 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 blocks here.
They're all called these blocks. The tiny blocks are an unprecedented country.
"And you say, ""Well, how do you define your home address?"" He says, ""It's very easy. It's the eighth ray."
"And if you're still asking the block 17 and the room number 1, ""Well, when I went on the front, I noticed it."" He says, ""Well, they're going, they're going on, and they're basically in the history of the tragedy."
The number of the first house in the block is one.
And then the number of the two of them is two.
"It's crazy. It's simple and simple."" And sometimes I'm going to go to one part of the world to see that most of us never think we're able to understand what we don't think."
For example, students in China think that their job is to keep you safe.
In the months you're giving you money to the doctors, and if you're sick, you don't pay any money, because they don't come out of their work, they're getting the time you're safe, because you're sick.
"Applause, in many music, we calculate that we start to a single, two, three."
"The Amma shows in Western Africa the end of a musical part, like the point that's the end of a sentence."
So you see it not only when you divide it in particles, but also when you see it. Two, three, four, one.
And this map is true.
It's a smile that I'm saying that what you're doing about India is that it's true.
So let's never forget how you have an idea in TED or elsewhere, or if you hear, it might be right.
Domo arigato gozaimashita. ( Thank you. Japanese)
