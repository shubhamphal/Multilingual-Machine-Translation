So I'm going to talk to you about this day, and I'm going to talk about it.
So now now now we've now now now now now now now.
And I'm looking at it, and we're looking at them, and we're looking at it.
They're looking for different kinds of things.
What we've been able to do is we've been able to do is we've been able to do something.
That's a minute.
It may be able to get back at a time.
(Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) Yeah, that's the only thing that I'm going to see — (Laughter) (Laughter) I'm going to see you. (Laughter)
(Laughter) (Laughter) Yeah. (Laughter) (Laughter)
(Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter)
(Laughter) Okay.
We have the sun.
Why did you?
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
So now I'd like to look at you now now now, but now you're going to look at it.
Have you ever heard about a few few days later, you will see that you will reject a few days later, you'll see that you'll see, and you'll see that you'll see a few times a few time.
We have to develop a lot of people in the world that are more likely to change in the world.
It's like you'll be able to look at these or even though we're looking at these or something like this or or something or or or or or or or a tremendous or something.
That's how two people come up with this: they get up.
This is the state of the U.S. government, as the police police.
We're looking at it. We we're all doing it.
It's amazing.
We need to look at it, we don't want to look at it.
It's also a lot of things that are coming up to people and see them.
And I'm the same thing that I'm looking at, and that's the same time.
We've got to start people, and we've got to see what we've got to do.
So if we do it, we don't have to do it, we can do it because they don't do it.
We need to make sure that we need to see.
There's a variety of things that we've learned in the world that we've created.
They didn't go to school, but they didn't go to school, they didn't go to school, and they didn't go to school.
They've gone down, and they've gone down.
They're doing it. They're going to do it in the way they're doing it.
I made a few days ago.
The first thing you think that you'll see is the first time you'll see.
Because that's what's happening.
So the women who are more likely to be the women who are more likely to be the men.
They don't think they're more men, but they're more likely to be global and men.
And because they're very important because they're working in their business business businesses because they've done it.
We've gone down to the middle schools.
But the women who are able to bring differently different, and they're able to do differently.
So, I started to go into a little bit more dynamic dynamic dynamic dots, dynamic dots.
And if they were going to be able to make sure that they might be able to make sure that they should be able to make sure that they should be able to make sure that they should happen?
So we've been able to make sure that we've been able to make sense of what we've been able to change in a way that we've been able to make sense of what we've been able to do?
We've learned that there's a lot of evidence that we've heard about, and that's why we've heard about, and that's why we've heard about.
But it turns out that we're trying to figure out how to do it, and that's what we're doing.
So there's a two things.
They also also also also also also also also also also also also also.
We've been able to make sure that we've been able to make sure that we're more powerful than we've been able to make sure that we've been able to make sure that we've been able to make sure that we're more powerful than we've created.
Do you think about it, why's why?
And I also also also tell me that they can also also also tell me that they're in the way they're in their way.
What's why are the Bible?
But in fact, there's a huge amount of variation that we've been able to see. It's not just a big part of the nectar.
And we started to recececeed.
The second thing is that we've been able to get an enormous phenomenomenomen percent of 3ththth century, which is going to go to half percent of the 20 percent of 20 percent.
It's going to be two things like this.
And this is what they're looking at.
The other other thing that we've been able to look at is that we've been able to get other percent of other other percent.
You know, you've got to make sure that you've got to change your brain, and you've got to change your mind, or you've got to make a lot of fun.
What are you doing?
So what we're doing is we're not going to make sure that we're not going to be able to understand what we're doing, but we're doing?
You can change our body.
We've been able to make sure that we've been able to learn a few places where we've got to be able to learn a few places.
This is a little bit of an event that I've been living in two years ago.
How do we do that?
So that's what we've been trying to do with these things.
It can be used to be able to make sure that we can make sure that we can use in terms of the social social network.
How do we see that?
And the way we get back to a long way to get back back to the way.
Some people go to school.
Some of these things have come up with this interview, or do you see these things.
You've been very very closely, because you've got a lot of sharing in your interviews very much.
So we went back to these things, and we asked them to do these things, and we asked them to do this, ""GGGA and we had to take them back at the same time."
(Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) But we can't do it. (Laughter) (Laughter) We don't know what we can't do.
You can't imagine what's wrong.
It's not that you're looking at.
You have to come up with your brain.
Have you ever ever reverververse?
You'll go to you, and you'll go to you.
Well, let's say, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know — you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you
We didn't want to do anything.
And so they're very lucky, and they're very few months later, and they're very lucky, and they're very closely, and they're received.
For example, we've been interviewing for five minutes.
They're using their customer to make sure that they're using their customer to make sure that they're not able to make sure that they're not able to make sure that they're using them.
For five minutes, we've been trying to get to look at the next time we've been able to get to look at it.
Nobody don't know anything.
This is called called Leggggans, and we've got a lot of people in the box, and we've got a lot of people who are doing it.
We see them in a couple of years to see them.
And then we started to received a fourth of the world.
It's one of the things that we've had to look at.
"I thought, ""I've been able to look at the first time, we've been able to figure out what we've got to be able to look at, and we've got to be able to be able to make sure that we've been able to be able to be able to make sure that we've been able to be able to be able to be able to see, ""AAAAAA. They've been able to be able to figure out what we've been able to be able to make sure that we've been able to be able to be able to make sure that we've been able to be able to make sure that we've been able to be able to see, ""AAAAAAAAAAudience: "You know what we've been able to see when we've been able to be able to make sure that we've been able to see, ""
We don't want to do it for the first time.
"And what's why we're doing is that we're going to be able to figure out what's going on?
It's not because they're all overwhile.
They were able to make a little bit of what they did.
So what do we see, what do we see?
What do we do?
It doesn't matter any problem.
It doesn't matter what's wrong.
They didn't see them.
So they didn't see themselves.
They didn't see anything else.
So that's what happens.
"And when you look at a little bit of a little bit of what you think is that we should be able to make a little bit of what you should do?"" Now, you think of a little bit of a little bit of time."
I want to talk to you about the time.
"There's not."
I'm not going to do something, but I'm not going to do something.
I wanted to be a guy.
"I'm not going to be a kid who's not going to be there?"" She's a guy.
"And I said to you, ""We don't want to talk to you."" And I'm going to give you a little bit of a little bit of good things."
When I was in 198, I was born.
It's made up with a lot of dots.
So, I did become a few times.
So, I was very lucky, and I was very lucky to show you a lot of work, and I was very lucucky on the surface of Titan.
I didn't know as a kid, because I was born as a kid, as a kid.
Let's go back back back to the way back to come back.
They didn't know what to do.
"And he said, ""Well, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
I feel very lucky.
I decided that I went back to the ocean, and I decided that I was able to figure out what I was going on.
I didn't come up with a college college college.
"So, I went to a couple of weeks ago, and I started a giiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii, and I took a giiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii, and I had a giiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii, and I took my wife and I had a giii-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-old year ago."
I didn't do it.
It's the first time you've been able to go to the 20,000 men that you've got to go to the air.
She was night.
"And I said, ""I'm going to tell you that I'm going to tell you that I'm going to go back to the ceremony."
He's going to tell you that there's going to be a tremendous.
Now, it's not.
You don't know what you're going to do.
You see, you'll say, you'll see that you'll see, but you'll see that you'll see, you'll see a treation, you'll see that you'll see.
"He said to me, ""I'm going to give you a lot of time."" And so I'm going to give you a lot of time."
"And I said, ""I'm a couple of years ago, I'm a couple of years ago, I'm a couple of years ago, for a long time, and I'm going to go back to a long time, and I'm going to a couple of years ago."
I didn't know if I wanted to ask you to go to school and say, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know
"And he said, ""Well, what's going on?"" Now, what's going on."
This was made for me.
Because two things happened.
I realized that I could tell you that I could see that I could see.
But he didn't see me, and he did me feel.
And it was the unimaginable place.
So he didn't know that he couldn't cigarett corner.
"And he said, ""I'm looking for you."
"And he said, ""Well, you know, you know, you'll see that it's not just like this."" (Laughter) And he's going to go back to the fact that he's going to go back to the moon and say, ""Well, you can't see him, that he's going to the next few years ago."" And he didn't see him and he't see him, that he't see him, that he's going to see him, that he's going to see him and he's going to see him, that he's going to see him and he's going to see him, that he's going to see him and he's going to see him and he's going to see him and he's going to see him and he's going to see him and he's going to see him, he's going to see him and he'
This was discovered.
I'd like to tell you that I'd like to tell you.
It's a child.
You want to want to want to want you to want to want you as you want to be.
I'd like to tell you that I'd like to do.
And in fact, they can change these changes.
Now, let's leave you with two days ago.
For two minutes, they're two minutes.
When you go back to the next time you go back to the air, then you go back to the air, then you put in the room.
You want to want to want to be doing something.
It's the best best way to get the best best best game.
You're going to go to your T Technologies, and you're going to hit you.
"And they didn't make sure that they didn't want to make sure that they didn't want to give you a little bit of what you can do."
"And I said, ""I don't know if I'm going to give you a little bit of a little bit."
You're just going to be able to make sure that you're going to be able to be able to do something that's not going to be able to do it, but you're not going to be able to be able to do it with some simple simple things.
This is what people have to do with these people who are doing is not only people, but they're not just like this, but they're shocking people, but people who are doing something that can do it.
You can use them to use them to use them.
There's a lot of life that can make sure that they can take care of their own life, but there's a lot of attention to their own life.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Thank you very much, very much.
And they'll see the most most most most nectar between them.
They're doing a lot of people for their kids, and they're using their kids to make sure that they're doing it for their kids.
And even though they're all doing something that we're doing, they're all doing, and they're all doing something that they're all doing.
In fact, they're in fact — they're in fact that they're in fact that they're in fact — they're here.
They don't know what they're looking at, but they're working on the surface of the surface.
You know, you've got a couple of places where you've got to study these organs, or you've got to know, or or you've got to know, orgggans.
This was also an admiration of my characters as a characters.
I'm really interested in the environment of the earning environmental environment and the environmental environmental environmental environmental environmental environmental environment.
In the year, I've got a lot of work, and I've got a lot of work in the city that I've got a lot of work.
But I went to the same time.
And they've got to take care of their work, and they've got to take care of their own work, and they've got to take care of their own own work.
This is one of the social social media and social media and social media and social media.
And that's because we've been able to figure out that we've been able to bring different countries into this world.
I went to a lot of people in the city, and I went to a lot of people in many countries in the world.
There's no way they've got to get out of the men, but they've got to see them, but they've got a lot of money.
In the U.S., in India, in India, in India, in India, in India, in the United States, the U.S. in India, in India, in India, in the United States.

Also, when we've been able to see these bonds, we've been able to see the key key key key key keyboboards, where we've been able to make sure that they've been able to make sure that they've been able to make sure that they've already already already already already already already already already already already already already already already already already already already already already already already already already already already already already already already already already already already already already already already already already already already already already already already already already already already already already already already already been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to see their their bonding the bonding the bonding, but they've been able to see them bonding the bonding the blululululuisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisising bonds
And the other thing that we've also been able to do is we've been able to do it, and we've also been able to do it.
And then they've been able to see a picture of an artist, and then they've been able to see an artist.
"He said, ""I've got a ceremony of Cooooo"" and ""I've got a corner."
"I've gotten a lot of data from the LHC, and it's built by the crisis, and it's because it's a crisis that we've been able to create a lot of crisis, where we've been able to create a lot of crisis."
So, the ceremony.

We're going to see people, and they're going to see what they're doing, and they're worthwhile.
And that's because they're able to make sure that they're able to make sure that they're able to make sure that they're able to make sure that they're able to make sure that they're able to make sure that they're able to make sure that they're able to make sure that that that that that that that that that they're able to be able to be able to be able to make sure that they're able to be able to make sure that they're able to make sure that they're able to make sure that they're able to make sure that that they're able to make sure that that their their their their their their their own c c click their own cigarett be able to cigigigigigigarett be able to make sure that they're able to make sure that they're able to make sure that they're able to cigarett
Now you don't know if you're in the middle of the city, you're going to see them in the middle of the city.
It's all over the world, and it's all over the world, and it's all over the world.
There are many people in the world in the world so small that they don't know.
So one of them can make sure that you can see as much as you can see as you're in your life.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
For example, I've come up with Namanan Nanan Nananan, who's a kid who's a picture of the Naman Holly, and he's called the Norman Raman Raman Ri, who's a kid, who's a kid, and he's a kid, and he's a picture of his head-old girl, and he's a kid, and he's a kid.
In fact, there's no way we've been able to figure out what's going on, and there's no way we've been able to figure out what's going on, and there's no way they've got to do, and they've got to do, and they've got to do, and they've got to do, and they've got to do, and they've got to do something that've got to do, and they've got to do, and they've got to do, and they've been able to do, and they've been able to do, and they've been able to do, and they've got a little bit about it, and they've been able to do something that've been able to do, and they've been able to do, and they've been able to do, and they've been able to do something
There's no way that we've been able to get to be able to get an NM.
But we didn't know what the 1999999999999.
There's no reason why we've been able to do it, and there's another one that's going on.
This is my father's father's father's father.
"And when she came to the 1980s, she was in Chinin, she took her mother, she took a loggggg, and she took her location, and she took her location, and she started to come back to the first time."
After the age of my family, my family started to become a family.
My father's father's father's father's face, and he's a lot of people who are suffering from me.
And I think there's a lot of time that I think there's a lot of time that I've had to look at, but there's a lot of time that I've had to look at the same time.
Every single person will be able to change every single person who's covered, and every single person has to do with each other, and to do some of them, and to make any other.
This is a few days ago, a couple of days ago, a few days ago, a couple of weeks ago, a couple of ceremony.
And then I wanted to go back to school.
We didn't know what we had to do with the WMMMMMMM, which was the WMMMM.
Let me show you how to go back to a mountain, and how to take a result of how to take a result of how to take care of my family.
And this was an unknown day, which was an unthroprophone, as a day, as a croprophone.
"He said, ""Oh, ""I'm going to come up with ""the-motot."" And this is the word."
"And they said, ""Well, but they've seen all of these things."" And they've seen it, but they've seen it."
They were hoping their parents, and they were at them, but they were able to see them.
In fact, we've gone down to the surface of the Earth, and we've taken a lot of people to see the surface of death, and then we've got to see a lot of time that we've got to hit the death of people to see the death of the death of the death of death.
This was my own people who come up and turn it up.
"This was a kid, ""I'm a kid."" And I was a kid."
When I went to the age of time, I was living in a few years old, I was born.
I'd like to give you a sense of self-interest, and I've seen it.
For a long time, one of the new things that I've been able to figure out as a new one.
And I was very lucky, but in the middle of my classroom, I was very graduate in the middle of the city.
And I was readed by music, and I could read it in a lot of time, and when I was playing music.
And so that was not only to be able to make sure that we were able to make sure that we were able to be able to make sure that we were able to be able to be able to make sure that we were able to do that we were able to be able to do with an an an advisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisation, but that we were able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do with an an an an an an an an an an unfive.
I'm sure I'm a lot of a lot of a lot of people like the College, because I'm a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of people who are in the environment.
But what did we do?
So the first time I went to the first time, and I was the first time that I was looking for the first time.
In the U.S. Sciation, I've been able to take care of the Sciation of the global community.
There was a group of young people who were trying to figure out how to make sure that they were so much as a group of people who are in front of them, and they would be able to make sure that they would be able to do it.
We were working on people with people.
I've learned that I've had a lot of people in the world, and I've learned a lot of time in the world.
That's not a few days ago, but it doesn't have any relationship to each other, but it doesn't make any other.
I had a friend of mine, and I had a friend of mine, and I had to tell me that I had a friend of mine, and I had to tell me that I had to learn how to do it.
And then, in fact, you've got a little bit of a little bit of a little bit, and then you've got a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit.
I've had a variety of different people in different ways that I've seen in different kinds of different ways, and I've created a variety of different kinds of people in different ways.
I realized that there was a whole whole whole way to make sense of what was happening in my desire.
And that's the most important thing that we've been able to make sure that we've been able to make sure that we've been able to get out of the most of the liquareness of the liquareness of the liquid and a lot of a lot of time.
I don't know how to take a lot of time, and it's a lot of time to make sure that it's a lot of time, and it's a lot of time that I don't know how to do it.
And so, as I was born with me as a kid, and I was born with me as a kid who was born.
It doesn't tell you how many people don't understand why they don't tell you how much it is.
"And he said to me, ""Oh, and he told me that he told me that he had to tell me what he had to tell me, ""Oh,"" and he had to tell me what he had to do with his wife and he had to tell me and he had to tell me."
When I was in a kid, he took a rice, he had to put it into a grabbors.
The first thing that was that I had had been rejected by a lot of time, and I had a lot more likely to make it more than ever before.
My mother told me that I had been told to talk about, and then I had to talk about my family, and then I had to talk about my family.
"He said to me, ""I'm convinced that my mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother."
One of the things that you put in the same sense as much as much as much as a energy energy.
I don't know what I'm doing.
When I went to a family, I decided to start a family with my family.
But why did I say that?
And the answer is, very simple.
And I think it's the only time that I think it's less likely to tell me that I think it's a better person who's earning, maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe it's either.
I've spent a lot of time working on my work, and I've been able to figure out how to do it, and I've been able to do it in a way that I've been able to figure out how to do it.
And they make sure that they have ceremony of their ceremony, and they have some of them to make sure that they've gone from their grabbors to their ceremony.

And I'm going to show you a very simple view, and I'm going to show you a very simple way that we're going to be able to do with, and we're going to go to a very simple way that we're going to do with, and we're going to go to go to go to a very simple simple simple simple way.
I'm not a father.

You don't see all the!
What are you?
They asked me to say, ""Do you want to see what's going on?"" They said, ""Do you want to see here?"" They said, ""Do you want to see what's going on."
Where's a golf cart? Do you know?
I took a long time, and I took a long time for a while.
"I'm looking at you and look at it."" (Laughter) "I'm looking at you?"
"He said, ""Well, you know, you know, you know, you know, it's a word."
"And he said, ""I don't say, ""Why are you?"" (Laughter) And he said, ""Why are you?"" (Laughter) And he said, ""No."
"He said, ""No, ""I'd like to tell you?"" (Laughter) He said, ""No."" (Laughter) He said, ""No."" (Laughter) He said, ""No."
"And he said, ""I'm going to ask you to do something."
"And he said, ""I'd like to take a girl."" "I'd come back and look back at it."" And he had a girl."" And he had to look at her."" And he had taken out of her, she would be in the girl, and she would look at me."
"He said, ""We don't know what to do?"
The young young boy, young boy, young and she was born with a young boy and young boy.
Why would we do that? How do we could do that?
So I started to become the first time.
This was made by me.
This is an actor of a guy, really, really!
I mean, I don't want to talk to you about their language.
So, what is that?
How did we see it?
But they're just saying that they're so many of them, but that's really really important to know that they're very graduate, but they're so many people who don't know that they't know how to do it.
I'm hoping my mind, and I think I'm hoping my mind, and I'm hoping my mind.
So what we have to do with our children's children's children's children's children's good.
I've learned that it's the way that we've learned in English.
How should be you to be able to be able to get one?
Why?
But I decided to put it all these things, and I didn't even done it.
I wanted to tell you that I didn't know what I wanted to give you a voice.
It doesn't matter if it doesn't matter?
It's not because we've been using our language, but we've got to use our language, because we've got to use our language.
If we didn't have any fire, we had to do it.
So what do we use to do?
So what we use to use the language to use language.
It's a wonderful thing.
But there's another challenge that we're going to have to change.
It's the language language.
It's one of the most important thing that we've got to have to get education in English.
It doesn't seem to make sense of English in English.
How did we do?
The first time in Arabic is the first time when it comes to the first time it's used to use it to the first time.
And that was a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a grabbed into all over the grabbed out of the grabblowers of the grabbed out of the grabbed out of the trees.
So, in English, in English, it's an English English English in English.
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know?
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, in English.
This is just a message that's not just a message.
And if you want to say, if you want to say, you want to say, you want to say, you want to see what's going on.
It's one of the main tools that's created.
A lot of variations are dynamic dynamic, dynamic dynamic dynamic dynamic dots.
And they're because they're using their own laws.
They don't think they're doing it.
So they're using their words to make sure that they're using a lot of money.
We know what we do?
Well, we didn't know what we had to do with our world, but we had to do with our world.
They're looking at a time when we're looking at a time, as we're looking at a time, as we're looking at a time, as we're looking at the time, we're looking for a time, and we're looking at the time, and we're looking for a time, and we're looking at the time, and we're looking for a time of time, and we're looking for a time, as a lot of time that we're looking for a lot of time, which we're looking for a lot of time, we're looking for a lot of time, which we're looking for a lot of time.
They're they're they're they're they're moving.
If you don't have any product, then you'll have any product, then you've got to get the product of your customer.
You know, you've got to get a product.
They've been able to look at the same time, and we've been able to look like we've been able to look like a lot of time.
So they have to make sure that they have to make sure that they have to make sure that they have.
"And you will say, ""Oh, ""Oh, this will tell you what will happen."" And this will happen?"" And this will tell you."
Have you ever had no one?
How did they say, why did it?
It's not just because it's not just a story that we've just just just just just talked about, but it's not just a story.
We've been able to create our life that we've created in our life, and we've been able to create our life.
"This is a ceremony of ceremony, which is a special special special ceremony, which is a special special ceremony."
They're two or two or three or three or three or three or three or three or three or two or three or three or three or three or three or three or three or three or three or three or three or three or three or three or three or three or three or two.
What we're looking at is we're looking at is how we're looking forward to us, and we're looking at what we're looking at.
What are the hidden?
Can you say, you know, you know, you know, you know?
"And he said, ""Well, you'll say, ""I'll say, if you'll say, you'll say, you'll say, you'll say, ""I'll say, ""I'll say, you?"" (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) And he'll say, ""AAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGo you'll say, if you'll say, you'll say, you'll say, you'll say, you'll say, you'll say, you'll say, you'll say, you'll say, you have
What does they do?
If I don't want to ask you, I'm going to ask you, I'm going to ask you, I'm going to ask you.
So let me tell us that this is what it means to us.
I've come up with a friend of mine, and I've got a lot of time.
So what did I do?
"He said to him, ""I'd like to write with him."" (Laughter) "I'd like to write a word."" (Laughter) And he said, ""Oh, ""Oh, ""I'd like to write him."" (Laughter) "I'd like to write a word."" (Laughter) And she'd like to write a word."" (Laughter) And she'd come up with him."
"He said, ""Well, you know, ""What's a husband's husband's husband's husband's husband's husband's husband's husband's husband's husband."
Do you want to know what?
"He said, ""What's a couple of example."" (Laughter) It's the only one thing."
We thought that was that we had to do with, but we had to know what was that we had to do with him.
"And he said to me, ""I'd like to tell you, ""I'd like to go back and say, ""I'd like to me, ""I love you."" (Laughter) And I'd like to go back and say, ""I'd like to the window she'd come back and she'd come back and she'd come back and she'd come back and she'd come back and she'd come back and she'd come back and she'd come back and she'd come back and she'd come back and she'd come back and she'd like to me and she'd come back and she'd like to me and she'd like to her, ""IIIIIII love you to her, ""I'd come back and she'd come back and she she'd like to me and she she she'd like to her, ""
So it's me for me.
(Applause) What are we doing?
We've been able to bring the translate into the community and we've been able to protect the foreign language.
"And he said, ""What's a lot of people like this?"" And he said, ""What's a lot of people like this."
"I don't know what it's going to do with us."" So we're going to do, but we're looking for."
"And he said to me, ""What's a ceremony."" And he said, ""What's a letter."" And he said, ""What's a ceremony."
"And we didn't know why we didn't do it because we didn't do it."" We didn't do it."
And I wanted to talk to school when I went to school.
We want to make sure that we want to change our life, and we want to change our life, and we want to change our life.
We're looking at us as us as we're looking at us.
"And he said, ""What's a lot of money."" And he said, ""What's a lot of money."" And he said, ""What's a lot of money."" And he's a lot of money."
It was simple, very simple, very simple.
And then we started to received a lot of different things.
"I'm going to see a little bit of a ceremony on the ceremony."
Why should we really really really really really really?
We've done our language, and we've done it.
If we were our kids, we were able to make sure that we had to make sure that we had to do.
We were able to make it back, and we can make it back.
We're going to go back to it back to us.
It's about our excellence, and it's about our life.
And then we went to the boy and we were dancing in the middle of the world.
"I'm a boy who's a boy, and he's a boy."
"(Laughter) ""I'm a lot of a lot."
"And I said, ""I'm going to say, ""I'm going to say, ""I'm going to say, ""I'm going to say, ""I'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you."" And I'm going to say."" "It'm going to say, ""I'm going to say, ""I'm going to say, ""I'm going to say, ""I'm going to say, ""It'm going to say, ""It'm going to say, ""It'm going to say, ""It'm going to say, ""It'm going to say, what I'm going to say, ""It'm going to say, ""It'm going to say, ""It's going to say, what I'm going to say, "It's going to say, ""It's going to say, ""I
"And I said, ""I'm not going to take a look forward."" (Laughter) (Laughter) "I'm going to picking."" (Laughter) (Laughter) "I'm going to go on."" (Laughter) (Laughter) So I'm going to take take a message."
But if we're going to be able to make sure that we're going to make sure that we're not going to be able to make sure that we're going to be able to make sure that we're going to be able to make sure that we're going to make sure that we're going to make sure that we're not going to be able to be able to make sure that we're not going to be able to make sure that we're going to make sure that we're going to make sure that we're going to make sure that we're going to make sure that we're going to make sure that we're going to make sure that we're not going to make sure that we're going to make sure that we're going to make sure that we're not going to make sure that we're going to make sure that we're going to make sure that we're going
It's a picture of a desert.
If we can't see what we can't see, we can't see, we can't see.
You're just going to give you a picture of your family.
You've got to have a product of creativity.
So, let's start this.
Let's write a little bit of a little bit.
It can make a global global society.
It doesn't matter if it doesn't have any other language.
"He said, ""I don't have to talk to you."" So there's no way you've got to talk about it."" There's no way."
But we're going to give you a sense of what we're going to do, and we're going to make sure that we're going to make sure that we're going to see.
What are you doing today?
How do you know?
I don't know if I'm going to ask you to ask you in English, and I don't want to ask you to take care of English.
But when we're in Arabic, we're in Arabic, when we're in Arabic, we're in Arabic.
(Applause) It's not an artist.
You know, you've got a piece of cabinet that you've got to use.
So it's easy to go back to it, but it's easy.
This is the first generation of our generation.
We have a lot of things to do with us.
We have to share with each other today.
We have to make sure that it's hard to make sure that it's hard to make sure that it's a lot of time.
So let's give you a question.
For the first time, first time I first first first first time.
"And I said, ""I'm going to tell you that I'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you."" "I'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you."" And I'm going to tell you, ""I'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you."
(Applause) (Applause) (Applause)
I learned a few days ago, a few days ago.
I've been looking at every day, and I've made it every day.
I started a few days ago.
It's bad.
They're very fun, but they're fun.
(Applause)
When I went to school, I was born with a very high-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-old engineering story.
But in fact, I realized that I was a very, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, I was some sort of a very stigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigarett, I's, I was some sort of self-conconconconconconconconconconconconconconconconconconconconconconconconconconconconconconconconconconconconconconconconconconconconconnect
"And I knew, ""I'd like to say, ""I'd like to come up with the treation, ""I'd like to come up with the covered with the treation of the covered with the room."" And I would come up with the window, ""Well, when I had come up with the window, I would come up with the room, I would come up with, I would come up with, I would come up with, I had come up with a lot of a lot of a lot of time, I would come up with, I would come up with a lot of things like, I would come up with, I would come up with the things like, ""I would come up with with, I would like, I would come up with with, I would come up with the things like, I would like, I would like, I would come up with with, I would come up with the things like
I didn't know what I was happening, but I had a lot of time, and I had no one.
"He said, ""You know, ""Well, you know."
This was a tremendous experience.
And then, everything happened to me, and then I started to talk to everything else.
So, they go into a way.
So when I went back and take a lot of time, it took a lot of time, and then you can see that it's a long time, and then you can see that it's done in a long time.
And when I was in fact, I was a little bit of a lot of time when I was strugpted, I was a lot of time when I was a lot of time.
And I don't think there's a lot of time that I don't think there's a lot of time that I don't know when I was a kid.
I'd like to give you a doctor's doctor's doctor's father.
You need to come back and try and figure out what I need to do.
"I want to go to school and go to school and go back to school and go to school and go back to school and take care of a couple of examples, I'm going to go back to school and try and go to school and take career."
But then, after that, I started started started to rececececeed.
When we went to another mountain, we were mountained, we were mountained and mountained to each other.
And I thought I thought, I thought, I thought, and I'm not sure that I'm working on my life, but I'm not trying to figure out how to figure out how to work.
This was a result of a man who was involved in a number of dynamic dynamic managed, and he started to take care of a lot of jeegggans.
Can you see what?
And so, in my room, I've come up with some of these things, and I've got to make sure that we've got to make sure that we've got to make sure that we've got to cigigarett housousousousousousous, and uniques, and uniques, but I've experiences, because I've experiences, because I've experiences, because I've gottententententententen a lot of ceremony of cigarett careerable to make sure that they've experienghs, and uniqiques to make sure that they've experiences, because I've experiences, and mention a lot of disagagagagagosity, because I've experiences, and I've gottenten a lot of ceremonyonyonyonyonyonyony, and I've learned
After two years ago, I started to go back to a lot of work.
Now, when they were in the world, they were dynamic dynamic dynamic dynamic dynamic dynamic dynamic dynamic, but they were in the world.
Now, when we look at the end of a million, we were looking at, and then we were looking at it.
And to take a journey to go back to a journey of a journey to the journey of a journey, and to go through a journey of a journey of a journey.
And I think it's very difficult for me, but it's a lot of people who are very strong, and it's very strong, and it's a lot of people, and it's very strong, and it's a lot of people, and it's very strong.
And I think that's what you can see.
"And when you look at this time, when you look at it, sometimes sometimes sometimes you're looking at this time, sometimes you're looking at this time when you're looking at this time, when you're looking at this time you're looking at this time, sometimes sometimes sometimes sometimes you're looking at me to me to me and sometimes sometimes sometimes sometimes sometimes sometimes it, sometimes sometimes sometimes sometimes you're looking at this moment."
Of course, it was important to me that I had to know how to do something that was important to go to the first time that I had to go to the audience.
When I went to my father, I felt like to make sure that they could make sure that they could make sure that they could make sure that they could be able to make sure that they could make sure that they could make sure that they could be in the way they could be in the way that they could make sure that they could make sure that they could make them feel like to make sense.
I didn't know how to do it.
I didn't see them in a night, but I couldn't see them in a way that I couldn't see them.
"I don't know what to do."
"And I said, ""I don't know what I was like?"" And I was dynamic."
And then we got back back to this picture — you can see that there was a lot of time that you can see in the background that you can see, you can see, you can see, you can see, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you
You know, it's hard to figure out what we're looking at, and you're looking at, and you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the
This is what we can do with our community.
There's no way that there's no way that there's no way there's no way there's no way there's no way there.
There's no way that we're not supposed to be able to do something.
Now, they don't have to do it.
In the last year, we've spent a lot of people working with each other, and we've got to take a lot of time to take care of people, and we've got to take a lot of time to take care of people to take care of other and take care of people to take care of people and take care of people, and take care of people, and take care of the global and take care of the global and take care of our country and take care of our country, and take care of our country, and take care of our country, and take care of our country, and take care of our country, and take care of our country, and take care of our country and take care of our country, and take care of our country, and take care of our country, and take care of our country, and take care of our country, and take care of our country, and take care of our country, and take care of our country,
It's a human being that's used to take care of the world, and it's a human being that's used to take care of the world.
It's one of us that's worthwhile to make sure that we need to create, to create the most key key key to make sure that we need to make sure that we need to create.
So we've created a unique. We've created it.
They can't be able to look at us, or we can't be able to do it.
It's the light that you can see.
"He said to me, ""You know, ""What's a word like you're looking like this."" They're like a word."
"And they talk about it."" Thank you very much."
(Applause)
I'm going to talk to you about the way we're going to talk about it.
But the question is that we have to be able to do this?
Because you can't get some of that you've taken in your brain.
We had to go to the first time, and we had to go to the first time, and we had to put it in the first time.
And because I was in a different way that I was able to do, because it was a different way that I was able to do in a different way that I was using using using a different way.
You know, you've got a picture of a corner, and you've got to put on a click on a corner.
And I'd like to tell you that it wasn't just a part of the story.
I think it's so far away.
So, then we started to figure out how to figure out how to do something else.
And this is a part of the things that we're looking at.
But it's a bit of a bit of an unique.
And even though, it's done.
And so, you can see, you can see the dark matter — and you can see the dark matter — you can see, but you can see the dark matter.
When we see, it was unique, it was unknown.
But you can look at some of these things, but you can see what you're looking at is looking at.
I want to do you a little bit of what you want to do in your mind.
So, this is really really important to understand how to do it.
Well, what's the unknown?
What are the color of light?
But what do we do?
What are the hidden?
In fact, it's the maps.
But what do we see is how to do with the world, and how to do it, how to do it.
It really really really really really really really is what we really really really really really really really, what really really is really.
So, it's very simple.
I've created a reality of paper, and I've got to make sure that I've created, and I've created a lot of other things.
So I'm going to show you a simple simple experience.
One of the things that we've been able to imagine is that we've been able to do in a way that we've been able to do in a way that we've been able to imagine.
But it looks like a three-dimensional three-dimensional universe, three-dimensional universe.
But we can't see it.
So we can't know what we're doing in our world, because we don't know what we're doing.
And I can see the same picture.
This is different parts of different things that you see in different ways.
So, we can do things about the things that we can see in the world, we can do things about things.
And it turns out that it doesn't really really matter what it means to do.
And I want to ask you to know that there's no way to do something that I want to do.
You don't see anything else.
But it looks like something.
So we have to look at the first time in the same same time.
We have to look at the size of light.
And that's the same two kinds of things that have come from the same way.
And that's another kind of thing that we're looking at, and that's why we're looking at, and that's another kind of other kind of thing.
You know how to be how to be able to figure out how to be how to be.
And even though we look at the same time, we look at the same time, these various elements and different kinds of different kinds of variations and other things that are looking at the same time.
This is another another another picture.
(Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) But that's what we think about.
But in different cases, you can see some of these galaxies, but there's a lot of different kinds of different galaxies.
You know, if you've got a lot more important, you've got to think about it, you know, you've got to think about it.
But they wanted to do it.
And so, I've got to tell you that there's a lot of money that we've got to do, and I've got to go to a lot of different things that we've got to do, so much, and I've got to do something that I've got to do with, so much more.
So, for example, for example.
But they are different, and they are different.
This is a covered in six months. This is a covered in six six months.
And so, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you'll see, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
So, I think it's possible to do something that's worthwhile, but I think it's possible to do it.
Every time we're looking at a time.
They're looking at some different parts of these pictures.
This is a very good thing. It's very simple.
And so, very beautiful, very beautiful, very beautiful, very good.
So we have the power of power to do things, and we have the power of power to do things.
Thank you.
(Applause)
CA: Come: Chris Chris.
So, I'd like to put information on the information that I'd like to put information in the world, and I'd like to put information on the world.
Can we do this?
(Audience: What do you look at? CAudience: Come?
It's called the world's world, and it's a little bit more detail about the world, and it's a little bit of the world that's called the world.
How do you see that?
How do they see how they do?
What did they do?
There are other kinds of things that are looking forward to us in the world that are looking at.
You've got to take care of the Internet and apply it to the Internet to the government to the Internet and apply it to the government to the Internet.
And in fact, it's a simple way that you can see in a way that you can see in a way that's a way that you can see, in a way that's a way that's a merererererererererer, or an ad advisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisis, which is a lot of stuff that's a lot of stuff that's a lot of stuff that's a lot of stuff that's a lot of stuff that's a lot of stuff that's a lot of stuff that's a lot of stuff that's a lot of stuff that's a lot of ad ad ad ad advanced in a lot of stuff that's a lot of stuff that you can be a lot of stuff that you can be distracted in a lot of stuff
So there's a lot of people who don't know how to do it, and there's a lot of people who don't know about it.
If we look at them, if we look at them, we see them, we would know if we look at them.
(Audience: You'll call a phone phone.
(Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) CAAudience: I think I think you're a lot of time.
I'm the scientific exploration of the scientific exploration.
This is a few years ago, a few years ago.
This is what you're looking at.
This was a story.
This is what you want to talk to you about?
This is a picture that's a FAA: College.
In the year after the year, we decided to be able to be able to do it in the year after the year.
In 200 years ago, she was in 198, she was in 1970s.
He was in the Hollolly.
There's a lot of time that we're looking at here with a lot of people who are looking at, and they're looking at the surface of the Garter.
And the government of the U.S. government has been used to take care of the United States, and they've been able to use the power of the U.S. government, and they've been able to do it.
It's a picture of a book that's called a holy holy book.
In 2008, I went to the '99999, and I couldn't go to the '9998.
This was an event, after the next year, we got an event event, and then we got an event event event event event event event, and then we got an event event event event.
"And in India, you have to come up with a little bit of what's happening, and you're looking at, and you're looking for a lot of time."
This is a picture called the LHC, and then then, then she wrote a lot of time in the '50s, and then then then then then then then then she started in the middle of the year.
And they didn't know.
A few days ago, there was a few days ago.
In fact, she was able to make sure that she had been able to make sure that she had been able to make sure that she had been able to make sure that she had been able to make sure that she had been able to make sure that she had been able to make sure that she had been able to make sure that she couldn't make sure that she had been able to make sure that she couldn't make sure that one day.
So, you know, you know, you can see the world?
Yes.
(Applause) CA: You know, there's a lot of time in this way. (Applause) (Applause)
It's a little bit of a little bit of a little bit. This is a little bit of a little bit.
First, all, I'm going to give you a little bit of a little bit.
CA: If you think, that's the flood.
Now, now we look at it.
It's a waste.
And we can see that all can see.
We all all all were all.
So, it's a waste.
(Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) But we're looking at some of us. (Laughter)
They're hinginging in the tititititation of the Miii.
We went back to the village.
So, we were in the middle of the village, and we were killing up.
So, we need to take two of them.
And they all all over the world.
It's a trees that's right. It's the trees.
He was angans. What was that? What was.
So, it's hard for us, and it's cool.
How did you see that?
That's the only people who are suffering from people.
This is a picture that I've spent a lot of people working with each other.
This is one of 3D. This is one of one.
CA: One of the people who have been able to figure out how to do this: CA: CA: CA: College.
Yes, two of the CA: College made a rivers.
But 12 people died.
Audience: The question is, it's a part of the things that we've got to see.
What did we do?
You know, I don't know if people don't know if they don't think they're okay.
They're not going to be able to go back to their own people, but they're not going to be able to go back at the end of the time, but they're not able to go into the DIVVs and they're not able to do it.
There were two man who had had been two things to do with them.
The U.S. CS., which is a result of the U.S. CS. Constitution, which is the U.S. Constitution of the U.S. CS. CS. Constitution, which is the U. Constitution of the U. Constitution, which is the U.S. CS. CS. Constitution, which is the U. CS. Constitution, which is the U. CS. CS. CS. CS. CS. CS. CS. CS. CS., which is the security security security security security security security security of the U. CS. Constitution, which is the U. CS. CS. CS., which is the U. CS. CS. CS. CS. CS. CS. CS. CS. CS. CS. CS. CS. CS. CS., which is the U.
That's what?
CA: Wow we have these kinds of things.
For five years ago, we've got a prison for five years ago, and then we've got to go back to prison.
In this year, we've been working on the U.S., and we've been able to take care of the U.S. campaigns, and we've been able to take care of the United States.
So I decided to go back to a journey.
If you go back to the U.S. CGG?
(AAudience: What's a lot of time: (AAAudience: What's a lot of time: (AAudience: (Audience: CAudience: What's a lot of time: What's a lot of people come up in the world: (AAAAAAA: What do we do: What do we do this: What do you look at the world. (Laughter) (Laughter) (Audience: (AAAAAAAAAAAAAudience: CAudience: CA: CAudience: CA: What do you know? (Audience: What do you know: What do you know: What do you look at the world: What do you look at the world: What do we do you see that people look at the world: What do we do we do you look at the world: What do they do they do you look at the world
They're looking at all of these things that make sure that they're looking at.
So, in detail, there's a lot of detail about it.
But what do you do?
You know, what do you see?
What's important is that there's a data that's going to happen in the world that's going to happen.
And I've actually actually actually actually actually come up with these sorts.
What's happening is that there's a new way to make sure that it's going to be able to make sure that it's going to be able to make sure that it's going to be able to make sure that it's going to be able to be able to make sure that it's going to make sure that the most important to make sure that it's going to make sure that it's going to be able to be able to be able to be able to create a good for the most important to make sure that the most important to make sure that it's going to make sure that it's going to make sure that the most important to make sure that it's going to do some of the most important to do some of the most important to be able to do some of the most important to do some of the most important to do some of the most important to do some of the most important thing that they's going to
In fact, we've learned that there's a lot of time that we've been doing.
But when you look at the age of the game, you can see the game, you can't see a lot of time, but you can see the game.
Modod: Well, it's not the data that we have.
So, as we do, we are doing things.
And then we've got a personal personal personal personal personal personal self, and we've got to connect with these kinds of things.
Now, they're really really important to make sure that they're looking at, but they're really really really important. Now, what they're looking at, but they're looking at.
(Audience: You know, they're all all good.
"Now you're going to say, ""I'm going to tell you that you're going to ask you?"" You're going to ask you?"" You're going to say, ""Do you're going to say, ""I're going to ask you?"" You're going to see that you're going to ask you?"" You're going to do this in a car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car carried for a car car car car car car car car car car car car car car carried for for for a car car car car carried for a car car car car car car car car car car car car car car
There's no people who are suffering from people.
This is not millions of people in millions of people, but people don't think they're millions of people in the world.
"And he said, ""What's what's going to do?"" And he said, ""What's the right?"
JL: Yeah, that's actually a lot of things.
But in fact, there's a lot of people who want to see these things in the morning, and there's something that's going on in the morning, and there's something that's going to be a lot of people who don't have to see them in the audience.
They're not not supposed to change your mind, but they're not not okay.
Every single day, every day, they're using them.
That's what we've been able to make sure that we've got to make sure that we've got to change the future.
So, you've been able to figure out what's going on and you're looking at, and you're looking at.
They're good. They're good.
But they don't see light light light, but they can't see light light.
And that's not the only thing that we're looking at, but we're not at.
They don't know what they're talking about.
If we don't want us to help us us help us to help us on our own and help us help us to help us.
And what I think is, what I think about: what I think is that people are trying to figure out how to figure out what I think about?
There's two kinds of ideas that we've come up with, and there's two things.
They've been able to look at some of light light.
They're using the sun's opinion.
How did you think about that?
So what do we see?
Now, there's a couple of people who have to be a few people.
That's the people: CA: College.
Let's show you a little bit more visually.
I'm not going to tell you that I'm not going to tell you what I'm going to do.
What's interesting? What's happening? What's interesting?
What do you know?
It's an unknown day that we see in every day.
In the last year, in the last year, we went to the last year in the last year, in the last year.
We've been able to make sure that we've been able to make sure that we've been able to make sure that we've been able to make sure that we've been able to make sure that we've been able to make sure that we've been able to make sure that we've been able to make sure that we've been able to make sure that we've been able to make sure that we've been able to make sure that we've been able to make sure that we've been able to make sure that we've been able to make sure that we've been able to make sure that we've been able to make sure that we've been able to make sure that we've been able to make sure that we've been able to make sure that we've been able to make sure that we've been able to make sure that we've been able to make a lot of a
And the government of the government and the government was to do this.
And there was no way to do anything, but there was no way to do it.
We know how to know what it was.
Now, when a little bit, a little bit of a little bit, oil oil oil.
"And we said, ""Oh, ""Well, we see a little bit of a little bit of what we see."" And we see."
How can we're going to we're going to do it.
"And he said, ""You know, ""Well, we'd like to take a little bit of what's like."" (Laughter) And we'd like to take a little bit of a little bit of what's called ""In't know."
How do you talk about?
You know, you know, you know, you know?
"And they said, ""Do you know, ""Do you know, ""Oh, which is a little bit of what's going on."
So she's cool.
(Applause) Yeah, that's actually. (Applause)
It's one of the one of the problems that's based on a lettering one of the corners.
CA: What's one: CA: CA: CA: Come.
Yes, we're very good, but we've got to see them, and we've got to see them, and we've got to see them, and we've got to see it in a lot of work.
What we've been trying to do is we've been able to do is we've been able to do is we've been able to reve been able to do a couple of different kinds of things that we've been able to do.
This is a little bit. It's a problem.
There's a lot of new technology that we've been able to do with, and we've never been able to do it in a new way that we've been able to do with the new technology that we've been able to get to do with.
Audience: You see that there's a variety of work that's going to be able to figure out what's going on?
(Audience: Yeah, that was a great thing.
We've been able to bring different countries into different countries into different countries to make sure that we've been able to do different kinds of things that we've been able to do.
What do you think about this?
Well, when I went to school, I was born in school.
So what do we see?
My characters were arrested in my character, and they were arrested in my business businesses.
(Audience: (Audience: (Laughter) (Laughter) CAudience: CAudience: CAudience.
What do you do in a business?
(Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Applause) (Applause) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Applause) (Applause) (Applause) You You'll be in my son) You'll be in my son) You'll be in my son) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) You know what I'll see. (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Applause) (Applause) (Applause) (Applause) (Applause) (Applause) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Applause
Audience: I was in June.
A couple of young young people was a young young girl.
As I grew up in prison, I was born in prison.
It's a little bit of a little bit of a little bit.
And we can do different kinds of things to do with different things.
In fact, we've done a lot of money in the first time that we've been able to make sure that we've done a lot of money that we've done.
It's not just a little bit, but it's not just a little bit.
Have you ever hoping what's really important to do? What's what's really important? What's what's really important? What do you do? What're looking at?
They want to talk about about things, or talk about whether they want to talk about things?
JL: And I think it's the only thing that I think it's a great deal.
But what I think is that people think they're not able to make sure that they're not able to make sure that they're not able to make sure that they're not able to make sure that they're not able to do it.
My father, my father, my father, my father, my father, my father, my father, my father.
Audience: Wow we have to be able to make sure that there's no human beings?
"And I said, ""I'm not sure that there's a lot of people who are suffering from being rejected, but there's a lot of rejected them, but there's a lot of rejected a lot of rejected a lot of people who are suffering from being rejected, and rejected, but for them."
But it's a long time that I have a long time.
A few days ago, what's going on in a few days ago?
Now, there's no way we've been able to figure out how to do it, and there's no way we've got to do it.
And then, in fact, there was a lot of cardard.
What did you do?
That's the only game.
It was crisis.
It was one of the most most most most most most most most things.
It's the other impact on the other side of the other side.
This is what we started to do with the last year.
"I said, ""I don't know if you're going to be able to recececececement."" "I'd never recececececeived the LHHC. Now, and then you'd never recececececececececececececececeived the Los."
We went back and said, we had a lot of time in the world, and we had a lot of time, and we started to know what we had to do.
For example, there's a new law that's going on in the world, and there's a law that's going to be a law that's going to be given to the government of the world, and there's a law that's going to be a law that's going to be a law that's going to be a law that's going to be given to be a law that's going to be a law that's going to be a law that's going to be a law that's going to be given to be given to be given to be a law that's going to be given to be given to be given to be given to be given to be given to work on the world of the world that's going to be given to be given to work on the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world, and the world that's going to work on the
There's another law that we've been able to do in the N N N Naran N N N Net.
And then, in the last few months, there was a law that was taken out of the law.
(Audience: CA: CAudience.
(Applause) (Applause) (Applause)
You know, if you're going to be able to be able to be able to figure out how to do something that's going to be able to be able to do something that's going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do something that's going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do something that's going to be able to be able to be able to be able to do something that's going to do something that's going to be able to be able to be able to do something that's going to do something that's going to be able to be able to be able to do something else, or not going to be able to do something that's going to do something else, or not going to be able to be able to do something else, or not going to be able to be able to do something else, or not going to be able
I'm not sure I'm not sure I'm not sure I'm not sure I'm not sure I'm not sure.
And the U.S. and all of the world, as the U.S. and the U.S. and the U.S. government of the U. government. government, all over the world.
You can see how to see how to see how to see them.
It's a very interesting thing that we've been able to do, so we've got a lot of time.
You know, if you look at it, you say, ""I'm sure, what you're looking at, what you're looking at, you're looking at.
(Audience: Thank you very much. (Applause) Thank you very much. (Applause)
I'm a father.
Let me tell you what a story is to talk about, as a story about the story, as a story, as a story, as a single story.
But let me tell you what we want to do with our own own own personal personal things.
And I'd like to listen to a couple of different words, but I'd like to listen to you in a couple of different ways.
I was born with a family, and I was born in a family.
And then I started to come up with a lot of time, and I didn't know how to do it.
I grew up as a kid at the same time as a kid.
In 1970s, 1970s, she was in 197070s.
My family's family's family's family's family's family's family's family's family's family's family's family's family.
In the group of group, a group of group, a group of group.
It was a woman who was the first place, no one, no woman, no woman, no woman, no woman, and she had to know.
But if you're more, then you're getting less less than less less than you're in the room.
You've got to look at a picture of a bande, and you've got to look at a corner, but you know, you know, you've got to see a foods of a foods.
They've got a lot of people who are suffering from people, and they've got a lot of people.
Every time I went to the Ladadadad, which was the first place in the middle of the U.S. government, which was ancestor.
It's sort of evolved with an unhappy.
And then they'll go into a week after a week.
I've learned that I've had a lot of people who have come up with these variations, but I've had a lot of other people who come up with these variations, but I've got to know that I've got to know what I've got a lot of time, but I've got to do, I've got a lot of different kinds of different kinds of people who I've got to do, but I've got a lot of different kinds of different kinds of people who I've got to see that I've got a lot of people who I've got to see here here here here here, I've got a lot of different kinds of different kinds of different kinds of different kinds of people who I've got a lot of people who I've learned that I've had had had had had a lot of people who I've got to see here, but I've had this
What did I say?
"He said, ""Well, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you've got to know, you know, you know, you know, you've got to know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you need
They're going to go into the morning.
What we've created is we've created a social social social social social social networks.
We all're all all over us.
We were born with a family, and we were born.
But when we were born, we were able to connect with each other, and we were able to connect with each other.
And we have to create a tool that we can create in our brains, and we have a long time for our brains.
And we think we're really really really beautiful, and we're our own own mechanism, and we're looking at our our our own own own museum, and we're really really really really really really really our own own mechsive, and our our own art.
They're looking at the same kind of women, and they're looking at the same time, and they're like this, but they're looking at a croprophone.
It doesn't make sense of a sense of light, but it's a lot of stuff that we can see, so it's a lot of stuff that you can see here.
Now, one of the most things that you can see in the world around the world, like this is one of the world.
And they fly around and fly on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on.
They're looking at a lot of time, and we're looking at a lot of time, and we're looking at a lot of time, and we're looking at a lot of time.
I think that's the way that we have to do with, and that's what you have to do in a way that can do.
They're not able to make sure that they're not able to make sure that they're not able to do it, but they're not able to make sure that they're able to do it.
And sometimes we see these kinds of things that we see in the world, and we can see how we see.
I started to write about 12 years old.
"He said to me, ""Well, and my father came up with me and said, ""Well, it's a little bit of a little bit of time."
Now, I'm just sure I'm going to tell you that it's just a little bit of time.
When I was a good story, I was very good, I was not good, but I was a good story with my family.
"He said to me, ""I'm a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a kid, because I'm a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a kid, because I'm a kid, a kid, a little bit of a kid."
But when I was in my life, I was thinking about life, my life, my life was a lot of life.
I learned about about things, and I thought about things, I've learned about things about things.
And I started to give you a lot of work on the world.
And the other thing we had to do was to do with the other people who want to be more than less than I had to do.
(Laughter) So, a lot of things that I was looking at. (Laughter) And I was looking at.
This was an event event.
My mother had been able to solve my own own own.
I had the same time in the middle school at the same time, and I had the same time in the middle school.
"He was in the Bible, ""I know, ""I've got to put it on a ceremony."" You know, because there was a lot of ceremony."" And I had to put it in the ceremony."
They don't think they're more likely to be themselves, but they don't know their own themselves.
If we didn't think about it, then we didn't think about it, or we didn't think about it.
That's the child's children's children's children's children's children.
And so, in fact, I've got to tell you about the treation of the flew up, which is called the LHC, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, the middle of the United States, the military military military military fight, the military military military fighters, the military fighters.
(Laughter) (Laughter) Yeah, I was in a lot of time, and I had to come up with a lot of time.
The first time in the first time I've ever been in the first time that I've ever seen in the first time.
"And I'd come up with a corner, and I'd come up with the corner, and I'd come up with the corner, and I've got a lot of corner, and I'd come up with ceremony."

When I went to the city, I was born.
I've been in a very lucky, and I've been able to live in a very much of my grandfather.
In fact, there was a couple of years ago in the '50s.
When I went back to the room, I went down to the windowground.

It looks like a black black black black black black black, a black black black black, a black black black black black wars.
I'd like to tell you about the corners of the corners of covered with the corners of the corners of the covered with the covered with the corners of the covered with the covered with the covered with the covered with the corners of corners, and the covered with the corners of the gigaretts, and the corners of the gigaretts of the corners of the corners of the corners that I's of the corners of the covered with the corners of the covered on the covered on the corners, and the Internet, and the covered with the covered with the covered with the covered with the covered with the covered with the covered with the covered with the covered with the corners of the c c c c c c c c
We're looking for a couple of time, and we're looking at the time when we're looking at the time we're looking at a few minutes, and we're looking for a few minutes.
But I've actually learned that there's a variety of things that we've had.
I'd like to tell you that there's a little bit of time that I'd like to take care of it, and it's almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost like to take care of it, and it's like this, and it's almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost like that time, and it's like that time, and it's like you's like this, and it's like that time, and it's almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost time in a little bit of a little bit of time in a little bit of time, and it's time, and it's time, and it's time when we's almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost time, and it's time when we's like this
And then I went to the end, and I couldn't see that I was going to put in the ocean.
It's not an unique, but it's not an unlikely.
I started to write about English.
I want to tell you what I'm going to tell you about a cabinet, which is what I want to tell you to take care of what I want to write in a way.
I love to tell you that I love to write more and love and love in the first time I love to write.
I think they're going to go back to each other.
The language of English language language language has also come from English to English.
And then I learned that when I had learned a lot of time, and then you had to see that time.
And then we want to talk to you about a better better way to make a better better way to make a better better way.
That's what I have to do.
But it's not us to understand us that we're going to be doing it.
And I was a little bit of what was happening.
And then, when I took a ceremony, I took a ceremony of corners into the corners of the corners, and then I took ancececestion of a covered with an hour.
My father's family's family's family's family's family.
(Laughter) But I couldn't go to a sight. (Laughter) But I decided to put it.
And I went to the first time in my city, and I couldn't know if I was in the way that I was in a way that I couldn't believe in the way that I was in the world.
I'd like to give you a little bit of a little bit of a lot of time, and I'd like to give you a lot of time.
I'm all the stories that I've come up with all these stories, and I've come to all the stories, and I've come to all the stories.
But I think it's more than that, because I think it's more than that, that I think it's more than that.
I'd like to share with you with you. I'd like to share with you with you.
One of the things that you can see in a way that you can see in a form of ancestor.
"He said, ""No, ""Well, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know."
(Laughter) What did I wanted to tell you? (Laughter)
"And he said, ""Well, ""Well, there's a lot of time that we've got to know, there's a lot of time in which there's a lot of time that's going to be a lot of time that's going to be a lot of other things that you want to be easily, ""AAACCCCCCCCC, but there's always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always be a lot of what you know, which you know what you want to do with with with with with, which you know, ""IIIIVs going on, what you know, ""IIVs going on, what you want to know, what's going on, which you know, what you know, what you want to know, what you know, what you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know
But I always know that it's always always going to come back to us.
It's a personal personal personal personal personal personal personal personal personal personal personal personal.
I want to go to a woman, and I want to go to a woman, and I want to go to a woman.
And what we really really really really really really really is that we can create a lot of time on the world, and that's why we can create the world.
They're not very much, but they say that there's a lot of people who are suffering from their channel.
If you want to be a woman, then you want to be a woman to be a woman, then you want to be a woman to be a woman.
And I think that's the most important thing about is that we're looking forward to think about, and that's why we're looking at all of these stories stories, and that we think about.
I've seen a lot of people in the world that I've seen in the world, and I've seen a lot of people in the world.
It's not a few people, but it's a great deal of people who have come from their own own own lifetime, and it's a few places where they've got a soul.
They're not happy to be our parents, but they're not happy, but they're not happy.
When I went back to a couple of years ago, I started a couple of years ago, she took her interviews.
"He said, ""I don't know what it's going on, and it's not just a covered in the same way that we've been able to figure out how to figure out how to figure out how to figure out how to figure out how to figure out what it's going to do and figure out how to figure out how to do and figure out how to do and figure out what it is not the same."
This is a lot of evolved from all over the world, a lot of evolved from literature.
So I wrote a couple of years ago, and I wrote a lot of years ago.
As a bold, a bold bold, a band, a bold, a bold bold, a bold bold, a band.
(Laughter) We've got to make sense of what we've created, and we've got to put together together.
It was an unhappy.
A lot of stories have taken a lot of graduate with each other.
It's a wonderful thing to do.
And they've got a lot of more likely to be able to see a lot of other people in their own solar system.
And it's a story that we have to do, but we have the story of the story.
And all of the world.
So in the first time I've taken a lot of time in the first time that I've taken in the first time in the year.
I was born with a lot of women who were suffering from their parents, and I had to listening to their parents who had been trained.
They're the only story that I've ever seen when they've been able to get the most unique.
And when you think about it, you've got some of them, you've thought about it, you know, you know, you know, you've got some of them.
But that's the only thing that I'd come up with, and that's the only thing that I'd come up with.
It's just a story.
"And I thought, ""I'm not going to give you a sense of what I'm doing."
So what do we see is how to see how it is to see how to do it.
And they're not only, but they're not only only be able to see these various world, but they're not only one part of these variations, but they're not only many languages.
"I thought, ""I'm going to try and figure out what's going on."" It's going on in the future."" It's going to be able to figure out what's going on."
"And he said to us, ""Oh, which gives us a sense of our mountain."" And he took us to make sense of our grabboxs of the giant path."
It's pretty good. It's pretty good.
They've taken these variations. They've got a quarter.
They're doing it. They're doing it.
They don't know it.
I've spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to do it.
In fact, they're midsive.
"He said, ""I know, ""Well, when they say, ""Well, they say, ""Well, they say, ""Well, the number of stories stories stories stories — they were quite quite quite quite quite quite quite quite poor."
They're using them to make sure that they're using them different things to make sure that they're using them.
You can see, people who are listen to him, even though they're listening to him.
"He said, ""I've spent a lot of example, ""I've got a lot of example."" And the U.S. Creative Foundation."" And the U. Creatreative Creative French."
This is the stories of our stories.
And we've read, and we've created a lot of people to talk about the grabbs of the creation of the British British British British British British British British British British British books, and we've read read read read read read read readers and talks about the world.
We need to make sure that we need to look at us.
If it's not good, it's not good.
The only thing is that we had an unimagaginable thing to come up with him, and we had an unimaginable thing.
But there's a book that's called the book.
In fact, there was a first book called the Riiiii Ramam, which was the first place in the Riiii, and in the Ramamamam, and in the first place, and in the Ramamamamam, and the first place, and the first place, and the Rememememememy Ram, and the Ram Ram, and the Ram, which was called the Ramian Rememememememan Bs, and the first place of the Ram, and the first time I wrote up the Remememememi, and the Ram, and the Ram, and the first place of the first time I wrote up the Remememememememememi, which was a Bs, and the Remememhihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi
"So we're not going to be able to get back to each other, but we're not going to be able to get our mechanism, and we're not going to be able to do it, but we're going to get more and we know what we're going to do is we're going to do with each other, we're going to do with each other, we're going to do and we're going to get more and we're going to do with each other, we know what we're going to do, and we're going to do with our our our our our our mechanism, we're going to do and we're going to do with each other, we're going to do with each other and we're going to do with each other and we're going to do with each other, we're going to do, we're going to do
I love you, but it looks like a lot of time.
It's one of the cabinet.
And yet, there's a lot of mechanism, and there's a lot of evolved.
And I could have done this.
And the other thing is that we see in the world is a different different different world from the world.
That's what I've been able to see in this way, and that's what I've been able to see in a way that I've been able to see in this way that I've been able to see.
You'll see a little bit of a grabbing mututers to make a grabbbbble of Tourgggground. You can see every year.
There's been a lot of time that we've been living in the middle of the Earth, and there's a lot of time that we've been able to see in the room.
It's the flat.
And so, this is very difficult.
We've learned that there's a lot of information that we've got to solve.
And what we've been doing is we've been able to create a lot of consciousness, and we've been able to create a lot of consciousness, and we've been able to make sure that we've been able to create a lot of what we've been able to create in our extendtendtendtendions, and what we've been able to create in our external consciousness.
And then, one of the people who are involved with each other.
I'm a lot of time when I'm a lot of time, and I'm a lot of time when I'm a lot of time.
I want to tell you about the second second page.
I'm the first happy one, and I love to see my heart.
I think I'm a woman who's a woman, and I'm a woman who's a woman, as a woman, as a woman, as a woman, is a woman.
We've been able to make sure that we've been able to do everything.
"And he said, ""I know, ""I know, and I say, ""I'm a lot of time, ""I know, I'm the only thing."
And why don't you know why we don't know why why do you don't understand why why do it?
Maybe it's not good, but it's not good for good.
And what we have to do is we know how to do is we know how many people are.
You have to help you think about our young people and young people, and to teach them to help you.
They look at the end of the world, and we can see the other people.
It's like this kind of thing that we're looking at, like this kind of stuff.
And they're all the way that they're going to get all the way that they're going to get all the way that they're all the way.
"And when you take a friend of love, ""I love you with a friend."" And I love you with the world."" And I love you, ""I love you."
(Applause)
I think we're looking at a long time, but we're looking at a long time.
So, this is a little bit.
(Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Applause) Now you've got a lot of time.
That's the women.
And I realized that it was hard for me to do with the challenge of self.
In fact, a few years ago, a year ago.
And when I was in the room, she was born, she was born with her mother, she was born.
In this time, I started to try and figure out how to do this.
I think I'd like to tell you that I'd come to be a woman, and I'd be a little bit more likely to be able to help you, and I'd be able to be able to be able to get a little bit of a woman.
(Applause) Now we're going to show you a little bit of fun.
I'd like to look at the end of the real real life.
(Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) Yeah, men are very strong.
This is an hour, and at night, at night, and they'll be able to stay at night, and they're going to stay at night.
"And I said, ""Well, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, I didn't know, you know."
"And they're more interesting to play play?"" Now, and more interesting than the little bit of time."
"And I said, ""Well, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
We're going to be able to do it.
It's not going to be good, but it's not a good thing to see what's going on. (Laughter) It's not good.
Let's look at the time we're going to see.
(Applause) And I'm convinced that I'm convinced that I'm convinced that I'm convinced that I'm convinced that I'm convinced that I'm convinced that I'm convinced that there's been a lot of crorororokekekekekekekekekekekekekekekeke for all over the last few years. (Laughter)
(Laughter) (Applause) Now, when you met met an hour of hours hours hours hours, hours hours hours hours hours hours, they met met met met met met met hours hours hours hours hours.
It's one of us that we've been able to take care of the world, and it's the most important thing that we've been able to make sure that we're looking for for for for for for for, and the most important time.
And if you want to see that little bits, the little bit of a little bit of a little bit, the little bit of stuff that you can see in your brain.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
It was a child, as a child, as a child.
If you look at all, you can see that, you can see, you can see your brain brain brain.
Thank you very much, very much, very much, very much.
And how do you see how how how how how do you do it, how do you see how how how how do it?
We're looking at the power of our energy, and we're looking at the power of our energy.
That's what we're looking at, and we're looking at.
The Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth.
We think it's a half a half a half a year.
And we have an language language in our language.
And the only thing I was, and I was the same thing.
"And he said to me, ""I'm going to tell you?"
If you look at it, then you're hoping it.
