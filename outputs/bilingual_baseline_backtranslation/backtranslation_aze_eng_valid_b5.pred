When I was in 198, I was born, I was born with a result of the age of the age of Titan.
My father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father.
There was no time when we were able to do something that was happening in the world, because we had no time.
"He said, ""No, ""Well, ""What's a father."" She's right."
I didn't know how to do it, but I didn't know how to do it.
"And he said, ""Well, ""Well, they're not going to go to school."" They're not."
I couldn't come back to the morning.
She wanted to go to school.
When I went to school, I had to go to school for girls.
So, for five years ago, we decided to go to the loss of the next year to go back to the next year.
You don't have to get education in education.
Every single day, we didn't have any different day, but we didn't see anything.
They're trying to make sure that we're trying to make sure that we're trying to make sure that we're doing it.
Because she was in a room, she was in the room, she was in the middle of the room.
It wasn't hot, but it's hard to see it.
We want to live our parents, and our parents are our parents, and our parents who want to teach them to live our parents.
Now, they've gone down to school, but they've got to go to school, they've got to school.
We didn't know what we did.
What are us?
What did we do?
It doesn't seem to be a school, but it didn't seem to be.
I think that was a man who was a man who was a mountain of a mountain of a man who had a mountain of a man who had a mountainment for being being being being worth worthwhile.
This was a human human being.
She went back to her father, and she was a girl, and she was born by her father, and she was born.
But my teacher had a teacher.
It's a terrible.
When we were girls, we were girls, girls, girls and girls are girls and girls and girls.
And that was the first place — my family was a family.
And because she went to college, she didn't know how to get education, she couldn't get education to college.
She didn't have education to be education as much as education.
When I came up with a year ago, I would come up with a lot of rejected my life, it would be rejected out of life.
"And he said, ""Well, I would say, ""Well, I'd like to say, ""I'd like to be a girl."" And he would say, ""Well, she would say, ""Well, she's going to be a girl."
You can see that, when you put it in a cameras, you can see that. (Laughter) You can see that.
But if you don't have to look at it, then you'll have to get to school, because you'll have to get to school and you'll have to get to school.
"Now you're hoping that you're hoping?"" Well, you're not going to be able to get a little bit of time."
In the last year, there's been a number of people in the U.S. in the country that has been produced in the country.
When I went to school, I went to school and get an education school — I had to get an education school.
So, in fact, I'm standing here in front of you, in front of you, I'm standing here.
(Laughter) (Laughter) (Applause) When I went back to the first time, I went back to the first time I went back to the first time, she went back to the first time.
And I'm not sure I'm not sure that I'm not sure I'm not sure I'm not sure I'm a woman who's not a woman, but because I'm a woman who's not a woman who's not a woman who's not a woman who's not a woman who's not a woman who's not a woman.
(Applause)
I had more than my family.
So, for example, a year of women, the women of their children is a global global society.
So for the first time, when I went to school and the first time I went to school for the first time in Afghanistan.
So, I think that is the first place in their school — this is a huge number of people who are earning their egosity.
And the father came to me, and she told me how they were, their father, their parents, their parents, their father, their father, their father, their father, their father, their father, their father.
I don't know if I didn't know what to do, but I didn't know what to do.
We went down to a few days ago, and we were dying in the village, and we were going to go back to a few days ago.
You're going to go to a phone phone phone phone, and then we're going to go to a phone phone phone, and then we're going to go back to the phone calls.
"So, when you look at the end of the girl and a girl, the most girl, the most girl, the girl came to me and say, ""I'll say, ""Oh, ""I'll say, ""I'm going to be a little bit of a girl."" And she'm going to be a girl and she's a girl and she's a girl and she's a girl and she's a girl and she's a girl and she's a girl and she's a little bit of a girl and she's a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a girl and she's a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a girl, and she's gottententententententententententententententententententententententententententententententententen, she's a girl, ""
Every time we're not sure we're not going to have to be able to do it, but we're not going to have an actor.
But as a result of a result of a result of a mountountain, a result of a mountain, a result of a result of a mentistististististististist and a result of a result of a mountountountain of the future.
When she came out of the ceremony, she came up with a little bit of a little bit of ceremony.
And then they're going to go down to Afghanistan, and they're going to go back to Afghanistan.
(Laughter) (Applause) Now, in Afghanistan.
In fact, I've learned a lot of time in America.
And that's what I've seen in the U.S. government, and it's a lot of time that I've got to see here.
But in my room, I've been able to get back to school and get back back to school and take care of them back at a time.
So, for example, I'm going to go to school and I'm going to make sure that we're going to have to be able to make sure that we're going to be able to make sure that they're going to be able to be able to make sure that they're going to be able to make sure that they're going to be able to be able to be able to make sure that they're going to be able to make sure that they're going to make sure that they're going to make sure that they're going to make sure that they're going to make sure that they're going to be able to be more better better better better.
They're just like this. They're all the things that they're like.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
It's a wonderful thing to do with every single person.
There's no blew up.
Let's go back back back back back and look back at it.
They've two things. They've been two things.
The first thing we had to do in the first time.
Every single single thing happened, every single single thing happened.
And I'm sure I'm sure I'm so sure that I'm so sure I'm so sure many many of you, as many, as many, as many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, as many, as many, as many, as many, many many many many, many, many, as many, as many, as many, as many, as many, many, many, many, many, as many, as many, many, many many many, many, many, many many many, many, as many, as many many, many, many, many, as many, as many, as many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many many many many
And then, it's a new kind of work that we've got to get ancestor, and then you've got a new work.
We've gone out of course, but we've had a few days later, but we've got to go.
Whether he said, ""Do you know?
So how to do them back to them, how to do them.
I don't know anything.
There was my life in my life.
This is what we started to see in 200 year.
We've done it in a way that we've done it.
We're looking at the base of the base.
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know.
That's what it looks like.
So what do we do?
"And he said to me, ""I'm not going to tell you what I'm going to tell you."
"And he said, ""I don't know if he said, ""I'm not going to be able to do it."" And he said, ""Well, they're not going to be able to do it?"
"He said, ""I don't want to go to school."" They said, ""No."" They don't want to go to college."" They said, ""No."
And they're not able to figure out what we're doing.
There's three three three three three three.
They're not supposed to make fun.
But it's used to use other ways.
They're all over the band. They're using it.
They're dynamic, and they're dynamic.
(Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) Sometimes she's bounded up, and she's a bound.
That's what you see when you see, you see, you see that it looks like.
(Laughter) (Laughter) If we're a little bit, they're a little bit, and they're a little bit. (Laughter)
They need fresh water.
Last Los Los Large Los.
(Laughter) It's time. (Laughter)
(Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) And we just just just just just just not just just just just just just go up with it.
I don't see you very high-definition.
This is a very dynamic dynamic.
You can see your friend of a friend friend, and you can see how to make a ceremony.
But you can see the little bits of them, and the little bit of the people who are interested in their own card.
(Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) Yeah, most of the time.
There's nothing nothing in it.
And that's the fact that we look at. And that's the fact that we see.
There's no difference between them.
There's no way we don't have.
They're hoping out they're hoping, but they're making sure they're coming down.
But there's no reason why we don't have to do it.
There's no reason there's no problem.
And if you don't want to go into the room, then you can't get into the room.
They're going to get back back back back back into the back back back back back back into the back.
(Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) Now, when I don't think it's fun. (Laughter) (Laughter)
And then they go back and go back and go back and go back again.
This is a process of process.
In fact, there was a lot more important thing to do.
You know, they're more likely to get better.
And they've gone down and they've come down.
They've been able to study high-performance girls in their school.
You know, they've seen a lot of evolved with angoror of a man who's looking at the same time.
We need to develop them.
But you can't see that when you're in a lot of time, you're so easily easily, you know, you know, you know, you know.
You have to be not supposed to be.
You know, we can see that it's hard to see it.
That's the right thing.
In fact, when we go into a cold air, we go to the air, we go to the Earth.
And then they go into a lot of information.
The sun is shifted by the sun.
They don't know what.
I don't have a husband's husband.
So, as we were back to be able to get back.
We have to be able to do this kind of thing.
And they've got a lot of classrooms.
They need to help help help.
But they don't don't don't do anything.
(Laughter) So, this is a kid.
That's the room.
And that's the tension. That's the nectar.
They're good. They're good. They're good.
There's a lot of time.
You've got to come up with a lot of attention to the battle.
(Laughter) (Laughter) Yeah. (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) Yeah.
Every one of you have to go in the middle of the room.
And that's what we're looking at.
And then we've found that there's a piece of data that's going on.
It's about 70 kilometers. It's amazing. It's amazing. It's amazing.
She didn't know why she was so much.
We need to get education.
She's a girl, she's a girl, she's a girl.
They're trying to go into the treation.
More.
Well, we've got to know, but we've got to know what's going on.
My father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father.
(Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) You can see what's looking at.
And then they come up with other hand.
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know.
(Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) how to do how to tell us how to do it.
In the last time, there was a kid who had been young children.
And so they can help them help them.
This is one of the other people who are able to do this.
This is an hour at the window at the northeast of 288.
It's about the temperature of the Earth.
It's not just a little bit.
So there's a way that we've got to come up with, and we've got to hit it.
But yet, it's still still been interesting.
This is a little bit of the road that's happening in the middle of the road.
They have the most most kids between the kids.
"And they said, ""I don't know if they don't look like them, they don't know if they don't look like them."
(Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) So we've come out of the dots. (Laughter)
I think they're trying to make sure that they're trying to make sure that they're more likely to be able to make sure that they're not able to do it.
Now, they have ancestor.
And how do we look at them in life.
You can make sure that we can change change the world and change the world.
This is a man who's created by a child's opinion of what's going on.
Thank you.
(Applause)
In the 1970s, I grew up with the 1970s in 1970s.
In the school school school school, the women who had been sent to school for all the school.
"He said to me, ""I don't want to go to my father."" And I said, ""I don't know."
After that, the only thing that was the only thing to do is that the only thing that I was happy and happy.
I didn't know what it was important.
But my parents had to be able to make fun.
I'm a lot of a lot of a lot of love.
She wanted to go to go to school and go to a young young boy to go to school.
They're using their school for school to school.
But I didn't tell me that I was doing something.
I didn't know that I couldn't get it.
But my father came to me as my father, and he said that my father were more likely to be like me.
So, I decided to go back to the trip to school.
There's no time. They don't have any time.
I'm going to be happy to be a happy one of my life, and I'm going to be happy to be happy.
But it was unknown.
I didn't know what I did.
Why would I have not have to say that there's nothing?
And I asked him to tell him how to do it.
"And he wrote his book called ""Go"" called ""MMy Firi,"" which was called ""My"" to give him a book."" And he called ""GGo."" And he called ""MMy"" and his name name was called ""GGo"" and his name."
"And when I went to the Lagos College, ""The French"" — we went to the first time called ""Man French"" French"" — we went to the Foundation of College College."" (Laughter) (Laughter) And I went from French."
Of course, they've got to read the book.
"He said, ""Oh, ""I'm a woman who's an actor."
I don't have any kind of thing to do.
I learned a few variation — a little bit, a little bit.
(Laughter) So, I'm going to give you a lot of time.
"And he said to me, ""I'm going to show you a little bit of time, and he's called ""I'm going to show you."
"And I thought, ""I'd like to say, ""Go you, ""I'd like to make a lot of time."" And I've got a lot of time in India, and I've got a lot of time."
He told me that he had a new way to make a new way to make a lot of time.
And that's what you're looking at.
For example, first time, we saw the first time in the first time that we saw, and then we saw the first place.
I didn't know that I was going to change the world, but I couldn't change it.
In fact, the map map map.
And they're not going to be able to do something that's going to happen.
This is a world called a standard world.
And yet, there's one of the things that have been done in the past, and there's no way that we've done.
It's a way that we've been able to do with people, and it's not going to help us do it.
And I think it's possible for us to study why? And why do that?
So, I decided to read things.
"And when I wrote ""I'm looking at the same time, ""I'm looking at the same time, the same time, we're looking at the same time, we're looking at the same time."
"I wrote a book called ""Inn't just a French."" (Laughter) "I'd like to tell you a French of a Frenchch."" (Laughter) The Firiririririr Siriririririrch."" And Sir Siriririririr Siririririririririririririririririririr Siriririririririririrt, who was a lot of his name, who was a lot of his name, who was a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of people who was a story."
They have to be the economic economic development of the economic economic and the economic economic development of the economic growth.
And this is the psychology of these things that I had to do with psychology and psychology.
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know.
"I'd like to tell you about the LHCC: "I'd like to go to a French Frenchchch: The Frenchchchgegegege French: The French Frenchgegegegegegegegege French: The French: The Frenchgegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegege: The French: The French: The French: "ICCCCCCCC.
"And I realized that one of the people who are happy and love and love with each other is not happy."
"He said, ""No, ""I'm a word."" It's a word."
(Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) But in the way we've come up with, and we've come up with time, and we've come up with a lot of time.
I'd like to know more likely to be able to get more than ever ever ever seen.
You don't know if you don't have any other people to do it with any other people.
The purpose of started to come to the purpose is to get to the purpose of honor.
It's the purpose of the purpose of the purpose of the purpose of the purpose of the purpose of nature.
We can make sure that we can make fun.
And I'm very happy to say that I'm very happy to see here, and I'm very happy to see that day.
"And I'm always always saying that you're always always going to give you all the time."
Thank you.
(Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)
You didn't have any time.
"I walked into my room and ask you to meet your room, ""I'm going to take care of your room and take care of your room."" So you're going to go back to the room and take care of your room and take care of your room and take care of your room."
And more than that. And I'm more than a more than I'm more than a real.
One of the things.
(Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) Now, when we went to the key key key key keyboboboboboboboboards.
"That's a catter of catatatter, and you know, ""I'm a corner."" (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) It's a catatter of corner."" (Laughter) (Laughter) It's a corner, ""I's a corner."" (Laughter) (Laughter) It's a corner — you's a catatatatatterterterterterterterterterterterer, which is the most corner — the most corner — you know, ""I's a corner, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, ""I'll see, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, ""I'll see, you know, you know,
It's a company that's a company that's going to be produced.
And if you look at a tremendous kind of tremendous.
(Laughter) You've got to say, ""I don't know if you've got to say, you've got to know, you've got to know, you've got to say, you know, you know, you know, you've got to say, you know, you know, you know, you know, you've got to say, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you've got to know, you've got to know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you've got to know, you've got to know
There's a global global society that we can see in the world.
So, let's talk to you about it.
A couple of years ago, I was a couple of years ago, a couple of years ago, a couple of years ago, a couple of years ago.
It's about five minutes ago, we're going to be able to put everything on a scores.
You know, here's a tool to manage the space.
They didn't know what to do.
And they have the ceremony. And they didn't do anything.
It's not.
(Laughter) Yeah, they'll see how they are. (Laughter)
(Applause) What's happening is that there's a lot of time that we've been dealing with.
I mean, I'm looking at it, and I'm looking at it.
(Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) And I'm very closely. (Laughter) (Laughter) And so much.
(Laughter) What was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man — no one? (Laughter) (Laughter)
Why are you? (Laughter) Do you think that's right? (Laughter)
So, let me give me a ceremony.
And they'll be able to look at a couple of years ago, and they'll be able to get out of the country, and they'll be able to get out of the country.
And then, after six months, six months months later, six months later, six months later.
So if they were not being able to look at each other, but they could not be human beings.
"I'm hoping that I'm hosticing, and I'm hoping the Randooo Remo Remo Remo Remo Remo Remo Remo Remo Remo Remo Remo Remo Remo Remo Remo Remo Remo Rememo Rememo Remo."
We've come up with science and science science science, and science science science science science science and science science science science.
Over the last time, I've come back at the last time, and I've seen it in a period of time.
Some people think they're more likely to think about it.
Well, let's say that there's a lot of time.
So we've got to take care of these things, and we've got to take care of them, and we've got to take care of them, and we've got a little bit of what we've got to do. (Laughter) (Laughter) So we've got to do is we've got to do with them.
So let's give you a little bit of a little bit.
I've learned that I've learned that I've learned that it's doing it for us.
"I said, ""I don't know what HI's called ""I've got a Ph.S. CN.
"He said, ""I've got a lot of paper, ""I've got a lot of time."
(Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) So we've got to go to school.
It's a picture of a catastastrop. This is an unique.
You see, for example, when you see that it's used to be used to see those images that are used to see.
(Laughter) Yeah, when we go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on. (Laughter)
It's something like this.
I'll show you what I'll show you.
(Laughter) (Laughter) It's a little bit of a diverse. (Laughter)
And that's why we've come to science.
I go back and go back to go.
(Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) You can't see all the time. (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) But you can see.
And the question is that the question that the question is that we see in the world?
And the answer is, if you can see that, the answer is, you can see the answer.
(Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Applause) And we're not just trying to make fun.
So here's a period of time that we're using here, and they're using a lot of time, and that's what they're using here.
People didn't know what we did.
And we've been able to figure out what we've got to do in the way we've got to do.
So here's here.
So we've got to take a picture of a picture, and we've got to put it in the box, and we've got to put them in the box.
And then we've been able to get some sort of shift in the last year. (Laughter)
It was an interesting thing that was interesting.
"This is a ceremony of a ceremony."
This is what about about the future.
How do we do it?
And I think there are some some people who are trying to figure out what I think is that we can't see.
Every year, we're going to get back to oil.
And so, very interesting.
You don't know how to do science science.
A lot of grab us?
This is a lot of a lot of a lot of people to get back back to a lot of people.
These things are two things.
It's not because it's okay.
I think we're going to do a different way.
You can see all the time to make sure that you can see.
"So there's another kind of thing that's more likely to happen in the world, and there's a lot of time that's more detail on the other hiddency, and there's another kind of hiddency, and there's another kind of hiddency, and there's another kind of stuff that's more hiddency in which are more likely to come from the way that's going on on on on on, and the other other other other other other other hiddenground."
"And he said, ""Oh, ""Oh, ""I'm convinced that you're doing it."
(Laughter) It's a question that's the question to give you a question.
It's not that we've got to know that it's not the world that we've got to have to be able to do it.
"And when he said, ""What would even even even even even even even though when he was in order to get more puated in order to get back to the world."" And he would be in order to get rid of that? (Laughter) C College to get more than that?
(Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) And that's what we've got to do. (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) And we've got to do.
"And there's a lot of time that you're doing, ""Go's a man who's doing it."
"I'm going to give you a sense of what you're going to do."" And then you're going to see you, and you're going to see you're going to see you."
This is what's doing.
(Applause) You don't know if you can do anything, you don't see anything. (Laughter) You don't know what you can do.
It doesn't matter.
It's the creation of the creation of the creation of creation.
They're dark matter, dark matter, dark matter, dark energy, dark energy, dark energy, dark matter as dark energy as dark energy.
That's the way that we see in science.
And this is the design design design design designed to see the design design design design design.
But the question is, if you look at the same question?
"He or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or

In the U.S., we went back to the U.S. CS., we had to take care of the U.S. government of the U.S. government, which was taken out of the U. campaigning the U.
But he didn't know that he didn't know.

In fact, we've been able to rececececeed, and we've had a lot of time.
And it's all over the solar system.
And when I went back to the fact that there was a lot of time that was an unhappy, and there was a lot of time trying to figure out how to figure out how to figure out how to do this kind of time.

What are they doing?
You've got a key key key key keyboboards, and you've got to have a key key key key keyboboards, and you've got to see the key key key keyboards.
You know, it's because we've been able to make sure that we've been able to make sure that we've been able to make sure that we've been able to make sure that we've been able to make sure that we've been able to use more likely to make sure that we've been able to make sure that we've been able to make sure that we've been able to make sure that we've been able to make sure that we've been able to make sure that we've been able to make sure that we've been able to make sure that we've been able to make sure that we've been able to make sure that we've been able to make sure that we've been able to make sure that we've been able to make sure that we've been able to make sure that we've been able to make sure that we've been able to use more more

In fact, they went to a number of people, and they wanted to know what they wanted to do.
"Afly time, there was a lot of people who had been involved in the tension of the CGGG, and there was a lot of time that we had to do with the CGGGA and the CA, and the CGG, and the CGGG, and the CA, and the CGGGGGA and the Fs, and the CGG."
This was a company called S Since Since Since Since, which was a number of people.
We've got a picture of the electrons here.
They're doing the government of the government to do the government's government, and they're not going to be able to do the government of the government.
But they have the citizens to do it, and they have the citizens to do it.
For example, a few weeks ago, the government of the U.S. government was prosecuted by a number of people who were arrested in the U.S. government. government. government, and they were prosecuted by a number of prosecutions. government. government.

(Laughter) So, they're clip.
It's not the way it's doing it.
This is the security of the security and the security of security.
This is the difference between the difference between the difference and the difference.
And if we do this year, we went to school and we did that we had to do, we're going to go to school and figure out what we're doing.
But what do we see? But we see in the future?
And as we have to look forward to us in the future.
(Applause) Thank you very much. (Applause)
"And I thank you for a lot of thank you, because I'm thank you because I'm thank you, because I'm thank you."

(Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) You can make a thousand thousand years later, and then you'll go into a mountain.
"And he said, ""Well, he said, ""Well, he said, ""Well, he's got to me."
I didn't know how to do it, because I didn't know how to do it.
"And I thought, ""I thought, I thought, I thought, ""Well, I thought, I said, ""What's a couple of years ago."
And then I realized that I made it, and then I made it a lot of fun.
"And I said, ""I'd like to say, ""I'd like to say, ""I love you."" Now, ""I'd like to see this."" And this."" And I'd like to say, ""I'd like to say, ""I'd like to say, ""I'd like to say, ""I'd like this."" And I'd like to say, ""I'd like to say, ""I love you."
That's what we're doing, and they're all doing, and they're all doing.
I want to talk to you about your journey, and I want to talk to you about how to you can change your journey.
For example, the oil oil oil oil oil oil, the oil oil oil oil oil oil, the oil oil oil oil oil.
I used to use it as much as much as we used to use the tools that we use to use to use.
It's a wonderful thing to do.
This was a year-fununun-year-year-year-old year-old year ago, because I was 755,000 people who lived in the middle of the year — three-year-year-year-year-old year.
I didn't know how to do it, and I didn't know how to do it.
"So, they said, ""Well, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know
"And I said, ""Well, you don't think they're not going to take care of people, but you're not going to be able to go back to the way they're not going to go back to the people who are, but they're not going to the people who are, but they're not going to do it."
But because of the oil oil came from oil to oil.
And I wanted to talk to me with this story, and I was talking about it.
I had a school.
"He said, ""I don't know if she said, ""No."" (Laughter) (Laughter) I said, ""Well, you don't know."" (Laughter) You don't know, you't know if you're going to go back to the time you're going to the car car car car car carried it."" (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) She She She She She's car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car carried me."
They've gone out of the kids in the morning.
"He said, ""I don't know if you need to go back to the LHC, you need a lot of time."" She said, ""No."" You don't need a lot of time."
So, I'm going to talk to you about two days ago, and I'm going to talk about one day, one day, so I'm going to talk about one day.
So, let me do this.
There's no word in the morning, and there's a lot of time in the morning.
I didn't know how to do it, because I didn't know how to do it, and I didn't know how to do it.
And I did tell me that there were a lot of them.
And I wanted to talk to listen to listen, because they wanted to talk to listen to listen to listen and listen to listen to listen and listen to the people who don't know what they wanted to do.
And when they talk about it, they talk about it, they talk about it, and they talk about it.
And then then then she was doing it.
And that's why we've been able to do with the last last last last last week.
And I didn't really really really really really see anything.
And I thought, because I was very interested in this way, because I had been doing things.
I was born, and I was born.
But I didn't know what to do.
So, I went back to the next few days later, and then I had come back to the next few days later, and then I had to come back to the next time that I had to do it.
So when I thought I thought, I thought, I thought, I thought, I thought, I thought, I thought, I thought, I thought, I thought, I thought, I thought, I thought I thought I thought about my thought.
But then, six years ago, six years ago, seven years ago.
When I was in London, I was in a year ago, I was in London, and I was a giiant, and I was in Jewish, and I was in London, and I had to learn how to make it work.
You need to get education and get education.
I had been able to make sure that there was a lot of time that I had been able to make sure that they had been able to do it.
It's about 70 miles away?
So what did I do?
And I didn't see that I was able to show you a sharing.
"And you want to know what you want to do?
Can you do that?
You've got to come up with it, and they've got to do it.
After two years later, I had been able to do it with two years ago.
My father came out to me, and she was my father.
"I said, ""I don't know what you're looking at, but we're looking at, we're looking at this time."
"He said, ""Well, you don't want to take care of you and you want to come back and talk to you and take care of it."" You don't want to come back and take it back and take care of it."
I didn't know if I went to the Praw, I've got to put it in a corner, and I've got to put it in a corner, and I've got to put it in Jewewen, and I've got to go back to the T T.
I didn't know how to do it, and I didn't know how to do it.
It's been two years ago, but it's been bad for two years.
(Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) And I went back to a lot of education, and I couldn't go back to a lot of education.
There are two things that are two things.
The first thing that we had to do is that it didn't get the first time.
"He said, ""No, and said, ""No, they said, ""No, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, ""Don't know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know."
"I said, ""Do you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, ""Don't know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, America."
So this is what I did.
"And he said, ""I'd like to come back and said, ""I'd like to come back and say, ""I'd like to him, ""I'd like to come back and see him."" And he said, ""I'd come back and he'd come up with him."
And I'm going to tell you that you're going to give you a lot of attention to all the students.
"Now there's a lot of time that you can see, and it's because there's a lot of stuff that you can see, and it's a lot of stuff that you can see, and you can see it."
And he told me that my help was helped to me.
There's a lot of time that we've been trying to see, and there's a lot of time that we've been able to see.
That's how they talk to talk about time.
She had to go to the first time in the room.
"And I said, ""I'd like to come up with a book, and I said, ""I'd like to come up with a book, ""I'd like to come up with a lot of other people who come up with them, and a lot of other people who come up with the LHCCC.
And all of these things are all of these things.
(Laughter) (Laughter) And I've taken out of the time. (Laughter) And I've taken out of the time.
I didn't know what I was doing.
After two people, we had to go to school.
What would you see in this way — that these things are happening in a lot of ways.
I don't know what it's like to tell him, he said, he's trying to figure out what he's trying to figure out what he's trying to figure out what he's trying to do.
It's not the only nectar, but it's not the only thing that it's used.
You're going to be able to do something with you.
You're going to be able to see all of your hands.
They talk about it, and they talk about it.
So we were talking about this, and we had a conversation about it.
I didn't see it, and I made it back.
But I couldn't do anything, but I didn't have any kind of things that I didn't know what I had to do.
If you don't think if you don't have a teacher, you don't know if you don't have a teacher, you don't know if you don't know if you don't do it.
So, I decided to go on.
"And he said, ""No, ""Well, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, ""Well, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, ""CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCccccccccccccccome, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, ""
"And I said, ""Do you know, I couldn't give you a little bit of a little bit?"" And I couldn't get a little bit of what I did."
So there was two things that I had been talking about, and there was a lot of two things that I had been talking about.
